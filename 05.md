## 湯問 The Questions of T’ang

殷湯
問於夏革曰
The Emperor T’ang of Yin
asked Chi of Hsia:

***

古初有物乎
‘Have there always been things?’

***

夏革曰
古初无物
今惡得物
---‘If once there were no things,
how come there are things now?

後之人將
謂今之无物
可乎
Would you approve
if the men who live after us
say there are no things now?’

***

殷湯曰
然
則物无先後乎
‘In that case,
do things have no before and after?’[^5-1]

夏革曰

> 物之終始
---‘The ending and starting of things
初无極已
Have no limit from which they began.
始或為終
The start of one is the end of another,
終或為始
The end of one is the start of another.
惡知其紀
Who knows which came first?

然
自物之外
自事之先
朕所不知也
But
what is outside things,
what was before events,
I do not know.’

殷湯曰
然
則上下
八方
有極盡乎
‘In that case,
is everything limited and exhaustible
above and below
and in the eight directions?’

***

革曰
不知也
---‘I do not know.’

***

湯固問
革曰
When T’ang pressed the question,
Chi continued:

***

无則无極
有則有盡
---‘It is Nothing which is limitless,
Something which is inexhaustible.[^5-2]

朕何以知之
How do I know this? . . .[^5-3]

然
无極之外
復无无極
But also
there is nothing limitless
outside what is limitless,
无盡之中
復无无盡
and nothing inexhaustible
within what is inexhaustible.[^5-4]

***

无極
復无无極
‘There is no limit,
but neither is there anything limitless;
无盡
復无无盡
there is no exhausting,
but neither is there anything inexhaustible.

朕以是知
其无極无盡也
That is why I know
that they are limitless and inexhaustible,
而不知
其有極有盡也
yet do not know
whether they may be limited and exhaustible.’

[^5-1]: If there was no absolute beginning,
we cannot say which came first,
day or night,
spring or autumn,
birth or death.

[^5-2]: Empty space has no limits,
bodies are infinitely divisible.
For the latter point,
cf. a proposition of the dialectician Hui Shih (c. 300 B.C.):

    ‘If you daily take away half of a stick a foot long,
you will not come to the end of it for ten thousand generations.’

[^5-3]: A proof of infinity must have fallen out
before the ‘But . . .’.

    The commentator Chang Chan
seems to refer to the missing passage:

    ‘Since it is called Nothing,
how can there be an outside?
Since it is called Void,
how can there be anything within it?’

    In his final comment on the questions about infinity,
Chang Chan mentions that the dialogue
affirms the principle of
‘No inside’ and ‘No outside’.
These phrases do not occur in the present text,
but they are found in a proposition of Hui Shih:

    ‘The absolutely large has no outside;
it is called the largest One.
The absolutely small has no inside;
it is called the smallest One.’

    The _Chuang-tzu_ (ch. 17) criticises this:

    ‘Debaters of the age all say:
“The absolutely fine has no shape,
the absolutely large cannot be embraced.”. . .
Fineness and coarseness are confined to what has shape.
What has no shape number cannot divide,
what cannot be embraced number cannot set bounds to.’

    From these clues
we can make a guess at the nature of the lost argument.
There is no limit where there is nothing at all;
there are limits only where there are bodies to limit.
On the other hand,
there is no point of exhaustion in taking away parts from a body,
since a body however small is not a void,
and therefore has something inside it.
Empty space is limitless,
bodies are inexhaustible.

[^5-4]: After affirming infinity
Chi proceeds to refute it
(cf. Hui Shih: ‘The South is boundless yet has bounds’). If a whole is infinite, the parts are infinite.
But an infinite space cannot have other infinite spaces outside it;
and inside an infinite aggregate of parts,
every aggregate must be less than infinite.

    Chinese arguments of this kind
present great difficulties of interpretation.
In this section I have made a point of translating very literally,
and confining my interpretations (which are disputable)
as far as possible to the notes.

湯又問曰
四海之外奚有
‘What is there outside the four seas?’

***

革曰
猶齊州也
‘Countries like the Middle Kingdom.’

***

湯曰
汝奚以實之
‘What is your evidence for that?’

***

革曰
朕東行至營
---‘I have travelled East as far as Ying;
人民猶是也
the people were the same as here.

問營之東
復猶營也
When I asked what lay East of Ying,
it proved to be the same as Ying.

西行至豳
I have travelled West as far as Pin;
人民猶是也
the people were the same as here.

問豳之西
復猶豳也
When I asked what lay West of Pin,
it proved to be the same as Pin.

朕以是知
This is how I know that
四海
四荒
四極之外
the four seas,
the four borderlands,
the four limits,
不異是也
are no different from here.

故
大小相含
无窮極也
Therefore
everything contains something smaller,
and is contained in something larger,
without bound or limit.

含萬物者
亦如含天地
Heaven and earth
contain the myriad things,
and are contained in the same way by something else,
含萬物也
故不窮
含天地也
故无極
which contains both the myriad things
and heaven and earth,
and is therefore unbounded
and limitless.

朕亦
焉知天地之表
不有大天地者乎
Besides,
how do I know that beyond heaven and earth
there is not a greater heaven and earth?

亦吾所不知也
That is another thing I do not know.

***

然則天地亦物也
‘It follows that heaven and earth are “things”
like the things within them;
物有不足
and things have imperfections.

故昔者
女媧氏練五色石
以補其闕
That is why in ancient times
Nü-kua smelted stones of all the five colours
to patch up the flaws,
斷鼇之足
以立四極
and cut off the feet of the turtle
to support the four corners.

其後
共工氏與顓頊爭為帝
怒而觸不周之山
Afterwards,
when Kung-kung was fighting Chuan-hsü for the Empire,
he knocked against Mount Pu-chou in his rage,
折天柱
絕地維
breaking one of the pillars of heaven,
snapping one of the threads which support the earth.

故
天傾西北
日月星
辰就焉
For this reason
heaven leans North West,
and the sun, moon and stars
move in that direction;
地不滿東南
故百川水
潦歸焉
the earth does not fill the South East,
so the rivers and the rainfloods
find their home there.’

***

湯又問
T’ang asked again:

***

物有巨細乎
有脩短乎
有同異乎
‘Are there large things and small,
long and short,
similar and different?’

***

革曰
渤海之東
不知幾億萬里
---‘To the East of the Gulf of Chih-li,
who knows how many thousands and millions of miles,
有大壑焉
實惟无底之谷
there is a deep ravine,
a valley truly without bottom;
其下无底
名曰歸墟
and its bottomless underneath
is named “The Entry to the Void”.

八絃九野之水
天漢之流
The waters of the eight corners and the nine regions,
the stream of the Milky Way,
莫不注之
而无增无減焉
all pour into it,
but it neither shrinks nor grows.

其中有五山焉
一曰岱輿
二曰員嶠
Within it there are five mountains,
called Tai-yü,
Yüan-chiao,
三曰方壺
四曰瀛洲
五曰蓬萊
Fang-hu,
Ying-chou
and P’eng-lai.

其山
高下
周旋
三萬里
These mountains
are thirty thousand miles high,
and as many miles round;
其頂
平
處九千里
the tablelands
on their summits
extend for nine thousand miles.

山之中閒相去
七萬里
以為鄰居焉
It is seventy thousand miles
from one mountain to the next,
but they are considered close neighbours.

其上臺觀
皆金玉
The towers and terraces upon them
are all gold and jade,
其上禽獸
皆純縞
the beasts and birds
are all unsullied white;
珠玕之樹
皆叢生
trees of pearl and garnet
always grow densely,
華實
皆有滋味
flowering and bearing fruit
which is always luscious,
食之
皆不老不死
and those who eat of it
never grow old and die.

所居之人
皆仙聖之種
The men who dwell there
are all of the race of immortal sages,
一日一夕
飛相往來者
不可數焉
who fly,
too many to be counted,
to and from from one mountain to another
in a day and a night.

而五山之根
无所連箸
Yet the bases of the five mountains
used to rest on nothing;
常
隨潮波
上下
往還
不得蹔峙焉
they were always
rising and falling,
going and returning,
with the ebb and flow of the tide,
and never for a moment stood firm.

仙聖毒之
訴之於帝
The immortals found this troublesome,
and complained about it to God.

帝恐流於西極
失群仙聖之居
God was afraid that they would drift to the far West
and he would lose the home of his sages.

乃命禺彊
使巨鼇十五
舉首而戴之
So he commanded Yü-ch’iang
to make fifteen giant turtles
carry the five mountains on their lifted heads,
迭為三番
六萬歲一交焉
taking turns in three watches,
each sixty thousand years long;
五山始
峙而不動
and for the first time the mountains
stood firm and did not move.

***

而龍伯之國
有大人
‘But there was a giant
from the kingdom of the Dragon Earl,
舉足不盈數步
而暨五山之所
who came to the place of the five mountains
in no more than a few strides.

一釣
而連六鼇
In one throw
he hooked six of the turtles in a bunch,
合負而趣
歸其國
hurried back to his country
carrying them together on his back,
灼其骨
以數焉
and scorched their bones
to tell fortunes by the cracks.

於是
岱輿
員嶠
二山
Thereupon
two of the mountains,
Tai-yü
and Yüan-chiao,
流於北極
沈於大海
drifted to the far North
and sank in the great sea;
仙聖之播遷者
巨億計
the immortals who were carried away
numbered many millions.

帝憑怒
侵減龍伯之國使阨
侵小龍伯之民使短
God was very angry,
and reduced by degrees
the size of the Dragon Earl’s kingdom
and the height of his subjects.

至
伏羲
神農
時
At the time of
Fu-hsi
and Shen-nung,
其國人
猶長數十丈
the people of this country
were still several hundred feet high.

***

從中州以東
四十萬里
‘Four hundred thousand miles
Eastward from the Middle Kingdom,
得僬僥國
人長一尺五寸
we come to the kingdom of Chiao-yao,
where the people are one foot five inches high.

In ancient times there was a great _ch’un_ tree,
whose spring and autumn
were eight thousand years each.

which grows in manure,
生於朝
死於晦
which is born in the morning
and dies by evening.

春夏之月
有蠓蚋者
In the spring and summer months
there are gnats
因雨而生
見陽而死
which are born when it rains
and die when they see the sun.

終北之北
有溟海者
天池也
To the North of the utmost North
there is an ocean,
the Lake of Heaven.

有魚焉
其廣數千里
其長稱焉
其名為鯤
There is a fish there,
several thousand miles broad
and long in proportion,
named the _k’un_.

有鳥焉
其名為鵬
There is a bird there
named the _p’eng_,
翼若垂天之雲
其體稱焉
with wings like clouds hanging from the sky,
and a body big in proportion.

世豈知有此物哉
‘How is the world to know that such things exist?

大禹行而見之

The Great Yü saw them in his travels,
Po-yi knew of them and named them,

‘Between the shores of the Yangtse river
minute insects breed,

而集於蚊睫
弗相觸也
which fly in swarms
and gather on the eyelashes of mosquitoes
without jostling each other,
栖宿去來
蚊弗覺也
coming to perch and leaving
without the mosquitoes noticing.

and lifted their eyebrows
peering after them by day,

Only the Yellow Emperor
and Jung-ch’eng-tzǔ,
居空桐之上

when they were living on Mount K’ung-t’ung,
after fasting together for three months,
心死
形廢
till their hearts were dead
and their bodies withered,

徐以神視

若嵩山之阿
watched at ease with the spirit within them
and saw them as massive
as the ranges of Mount Sung,

listened at ease with the forces within them
and heard them crashing
as loud as thunder.

and eating its skin and juice
cures fits.

but when planted North of the Huai
it changes into a dwarf orange.

The mountains
T’ai-hsing

are seven hundred miles square,
and seven hundred thousand feet high.

本在冀州

They stood originally between Chi-chou
on the North

北山愚公者
年且九十
面山而居
When Mister Simple of North Mountain
was nearly ninety,
he was living opposite them;
懲山北之塞
出入之迂也
and it vexed him that,
with the North flank of the mountains blocking the road,
it was such a long way round to come and go.

聚室
而謀曰
He called together the family
and made a proposal:

***

吾與汝
畢力平險
指通豫南
達于漢陰
可乎
‘Do you agree
that we should make every effort to level the high ground,
so that there is a clear road straight
through to South of Yü
and down to the South bank of the Han river?’

***

雜然相許
They all agreed.

其妻獻疑曰
But his wife raised difficulties:

***

以君之力
曾不能損魁父之丘
‘You are too weak
to reduce even the smallest hillock;
如太形
王屋何
what can you do with T’ai-hsing
and Wang-wu?

且
焉置土石
Besides,
where will you put the earth and stones?’

***

雜曰
They all answered:

***

投諸渤海之尾
隱土之北
‘Throw them in the tail of the Gulf of Chih-li,
North of Yin-t’u.’

***

遂
率子孫荷擔者三夫
Then,
taking his son and grandson as porters,
叩石
墾壤
he broke stones
and dug up earth,
箕畚運
於渤海之尾
which they transported in hods and baskets
to the tail of the Gulf of Chih-li.

鄰人京城氏之
孀妻有遺男
始齓
跳往助之
The son of their neighbour Mr Ching-ch’eng,
born to his widow after his death,
and now just cutting his second teeth,
ran away to help them.

寒暑易節
始一反焉
Mister Simple did not come home
until the hot season had given way to the cold.

河曲智叟

曰
Old Wiseacre of River Bend
smiled and tried to stop him,
saying:

***

甚矣汝之不惠
‘How can you be so unwise?

以殘年餘力
曾不能毀山之一毛
其如土石何
With the last strength of your declining years,
you cannot even damage one blade of grass on the mountains;
what can you do to stones and earth?’

***

北山愚公長息
曰
Mister Simple of North Mountain breathed a long sigh,
and said:

***

汝心之固
固不可徹
‘Certainly your mind is set too firm
for me ever to penetrate it.

曾不若孀妻弱子
You are not even as clever as the widow’s little child.

雖我之死

Even when I die,
I shall have sons surviving me.

子又生孫
孫又生子
My sons will beget me more grandsons,
my grandsons in their turn will have sons,
子又有子

and these will have more sons
and grandsons.

子子孫孫

My descendants will go on for ever,
but the mountains will get no bigger.

何苦而不平
Why should there be any difficulty about levelling it?’

***

河曲智叟亡以應
Old Wiseacre of River Bend was at a loss for an answer.

***

操蛇之神
聞之
懼其不已也
The mountain spirits which carry snakes in their hands
heard about it,
and were afraid he would not give up.

告之於帝
帝感其誠
They reported it to God,
who was moved by his sincerity,
命夸蛾氏二子
負二山
and commanded the two sons of K’ua-erh
to carry the mountains on their backs
一厝朔東
一厝雍南
and put one in Shuo-tung,
the other in Yung-nan.

自此

Since this time
there has been no high ground

夸父
不量力
K’ua-fu,
rating his strength too high,
欲追日影

wanted to chase the daylight,
and pursued it to the brink of the Yü valley.[^5-5]

渴
欲得飲
赴飲
He was thirsty
and wished to drink,
and hurried to drink
河
渭
the Yellow River
and the Wei.

河

The Yellow River
and the Wei
did not quench his thirst,
將走北

intending to drink the Great Marsh,
未至道

but died of thirst
on the road before he reached it.

棄其杖
尸膏肉所浸

The staff which he dropped
soaked up the fat and flesh of his corpse
and grew into Teng forest.

鄧林彌
廣數千里焉
Teng forest spread
until it covered several thousand miles.

[^5-5]: Yü-yüan,
where the setting sun goes for the night.
K’ua-fu is variously described as a divine animal,
and as a man wearing a pair of snakes as earrings
and carrying another pair in his hands.

大禹曰
The Great Yü said:

***

六合之閒
四海之內
‘Within the six directions,
inside the four seas,
照之以日月
經之以星辰
everything is lit by the sun and moon,
traversed by the stars,
紀之以四時
要之以太歲
ordered by the four seasons,
presided over by the Year Star.

神靈所生
其物
異形
或夭或壽
The things
which divine intelligence begets
differ in shape
and in length of life;
唯聖人能通其道
only the sage can understand their Way.’

***

夏革曰
Chi of Hsia said:

***

然則亦有
不待神靈而生
不待陰陽而形
不待日月而明
‘But there are also those
which do not need the divine intelligence to beget them,
nor the Yin and Yang to shape them,
nor sun and moon to light them;
不待殺戮而夭
不待將迎而壽
which die young without needing an executioner to kill them,
live long without needing anyone to welcome or see them off;
不持五穀而食
不待繒纊而衣
不待舟車而行
which do not need the five grains for food,
nor floss silk for clothing,
nor boat and car for travel.

其道自然
非聖人之所通也
Their Way is to be as they are of themselves;
it is beyond the sage’s understanding.’

禹之治水土也
迷而失塗
When Yü was draining the Flood,
he blundered and lost his way,

and came by mistake to a country
on the Northern shore of the North sea,
不知距

who knows how many
thousands and myriads of miles
from the Middle Kingdom.

其國名曰終北
The name of this country is Utmost North;

and right in the middle is a mountain
named Urn Peak,
shaped like a pot with a small mouth.

頂有口

On the summit there is an opening,
round like a bracelet,
which is named the Cave of Plenty.

有水湧出

Waters bubble out of it,
named the Divine Spring,
臭過蘭椒
味過醪醴
which smell sweeter than orchids and spices,
taste sweeter than wine and musk.

一源分為四埒

Old and young live as equals,
and no one is ruler or subject;
男女雜游
不媒不聘
men and women mingle freely,
without go-betweens and betrothal presents.

緣水而居
不耕不稼
Living close to the waters,
they have no need to plough and sow,
土氣溫適
不織不衣
nor to weave and clothe themselves,
since the climate is so warm.

百年而死
不夭不病
They live out their span of a hundred years,
without sickness and early deaths;
其民孳阜亡數
有喜樂
and the people proliferate in countless numbers,
knowing pleasure and happiness,
亡衰老
哀苦
ignorant of decay, old age,
sorrow and anguish.

其俗好聲
By custom they are lovers of music;
相攜而迭謠
終日不輟音
they hold hands and take turns to sing ballads,
and never stop singing all day.

饑惓
則飲神瀵
力志和平
Hungry and tiring
they drink the Divine Spring,
and are soothed and refreshed body and mind,

and so drunk,
if they take too much,
that they do not wake for ten days.

沐浴神瀵
膚色脂澤
When they bathe and wash their hair in the Divine Spring,
their complexions grow sleek and moist,

does not leave them for ten days.[^5-6]

Beauty and enchantment fill your harem,

Raise your voice,
and a million foot-soldiers rise;
視
撝
則諸侯從命
a glance,
a lift of the hand,
and the other states obey you.

亦奚羨於彼
而棄齊國之社稷
從戎夷之國乎
Why should you long for somewhere else,
abandoning the altars of Ch’i
to follow a nation of barbarians?

此仲父之耄
柰何從之
This is a senile whim of Kuan Chung;
why should you follow it?’

***

桓公乃止
以隰朋之言告管仲
Then Duke Huan changed his mind,
and told Kuan Chung what Hsi Peng had said.

仲曰
Kuan Chung answered:

***

此固非朋之所及也
‘Of course this is beyond Hsi P’eng’s understanding.

臣恐彼國之不可知之也
I am afraid that we shall never know that country.

齊國之富奚戀
But why care for the wealth of Ch’i?

隰朋之言奚顧
Why regard what Hsi P’eng says?’

and emended to U+24B54 (⿰車瓦) in _Concordance_.

[^5-6]: Unlike other accounts
of ideal communities in the _Lieh-tzǔ_ (cf. pp. 34ff.),
this looks as though it may be inspired
by confused reports of real primitive peoples,
arousing the same nostalgia in Taoists
as the early reports of Polynesia did in Europe.
The author,
like an eighteenth-century _philosophe_,
compares their customs favourably
with those of the civilised world.

travelling by boat on water

which of them is appropriate
is grasped without speech

When a first son is born
they cut him up
and eat him;

and they say that this will make the mother more fertile.

其大父死
負其大母

孔子東游
見兩小兒辯鬭
問其故
When Confucius was travelling in the East,
he saw two small children arguing
and asked them the reason.

一兒曰我以
日始出時去人近
而
日中時遠也
One child said he thought
that the sun is nearer to us at sunrise,
the other
that it is nearer at noon.

一兒曰我以
The first child said:

***

日初出
大如車蓋
‘When the sun first rises
it is as big as the cover of a car;
及日中
則如盤盂
by noon
it is as small as a plate or a bowl.

此不為
遠者小
而近者大乎
Don’t you think
it must be nearer when it is big
than when it is small?’

***

一兒曰
The other child answered:

***

日初出
滄滄涼涼
‘When the sun first rises
the air is cool,
及其日中
如探湯
by noon
it is like dipping your hand in hot water.

此不為
近者熱
而遠者涼乎
Don’t you think
it must be nearer when it is hot
than when it is cool?’

孔子不能決也
Confucius could not decide the question.

兩小兒笑曰
The two children laughed:

孰為汝多知乎
‘Who says you are a learned man?’

均
天下之
至理也
Equalising the give and the pull
is the ultimate principle
of dealing with the world.

連於形物亦然
The same applies to the things within it.

均
‘_Equalising_.

髮
均縣
Let a hair hang
so that the give and pull are equal.

輕
重
而髮絕
髮不均也
Pull too hard,
give too easily,
and the hair will snap,
because the give and pull are not equal.

均也
其絕也
莫絕
If they were kept equal,
nothing that snaps
would snap.’[^5-7]

人以為不然
自有知其然者也
Men doubt this,
but there have been those who knew that it is so.

詹何
以獨繭絲
為綸
Chan Ho
made a fishing line
from a single thread of silk out of the cocoon,
芒鍼
為釣
a hook
from a beard of wheat,
荊篠
為竿
a rod
from one of the pygmy bamboos of Ch’u,
剖粒
為餌
and baited it
with a split grain of rice.

引盈車之魚
於百仞之淵
汩流之中
He hooked a fish big enough to fill a cart,
in the middle of a swift current
in waters seven hundred feet deep.

綸不絕
鉤不伸
竿不撓
The line did not snap,
the hook did not straighten out,
the rod did not bend,
because he let out and drew in the line
following the pull and give of the water.

楚王
聞而異之
召問其故
The King of Ch’u
marvelled when he heard of it,
and summoned him to ask him the reason.

詹何曰
Chan Ho told him:

***

臣聞先大夫
之言蒲且子之弋也
‘I heard my late father
speak of P’u-chü-tzǔ’s archery
with a line attached to the arrow.

弱弓
纖繳
Using a weak bow
and thin line,
乘風
振之
and shaking the line
so that it rode with the winds,
連雙鶬
於青雲之際
he transfixed both of a pair of black cranes
on the edge of a dark cloud---
用心專
動手
均也
because his attention was concentrated
and the movement of his hand
equalised the give and the pull.

臣因其事
放而學釣
I profited by this story,
and took it as my model when I learned to fish.

五年
始盡其道
It took me five years
to learn all that there is to learn about this Way.

當臣之臨河持竿
心无雜慮
When I overlook the river holding my rod,
there are no distracting thoughts in my mind.

唯魚之念
I contemplate nothing but the fish.

投綸
沈釣
When I cast the line
and sink the hook,
手无輕重
物莫能亂
my hand does not pull too hard nor give too easily,
so that nothing can disturb it.

魚見臣之釣餌
猶沈埃聚沫
吞之不疑
When the fish see the bait on my hook,
it is like sinking dust or gathered foam,
and they swallow it without suspecting.

所以能
以弱制彊
以輕致重也
This is how I am able
to use weak things to control strong ones,
light things to bring in heavy ones.

大王
治國誠能若此
則天下可運於一握
If Your Majesty
is really able to rule his state in the same way,
he can turn the Empire within the span of his hand;
將亦奚事哉
what can give you trouble?’

魯公扈
趙齊嬰
二人有疾
同請扁鵲求治
Kung Hu of Lu
and Ch’i Ying of Chao
fell ill,
and both asked P’ien Ch’iao to treat them.

扁鵲治之
既同愈
謂公扈
齊嬰曰
P’ien Ch’iao did treat them
and when they had both recovered
told them:

***

汝曩之所疾
自外而干府藏者
固藥石之所已
‘You have just been suffering from diseases
which attacked your organs from outside,
and which of course medicine and the needle can cure.

今有偕生之疾
與體偕長
But you also have diseases which were born with you
and have grown with the growth of your bodies;
今為汝攻之何如
would you like me to treat them for you?’

***

二人曰
願先聞其驗
‘First tell us what makes you think so.’

***

扁鵲謂公扈曰
汝志彊而氣弱
‘Your ambition is greater than your energy,’
said P’ien Ch’iao to Kung Hu,
故足於謀
而寡於斷
‘so that you are capable of forming plans
but seldom come to decisions.

齊嬰志弱而氣彊
故少於慮
而傷於專
Ch’i Ying’s energy is greater than his ambition,
so that he rarely thinks ahead
and comes to grief by acting irresponsibly.

若換汝之心
則均於善矣
If I exchange your hearts
you will benefit by the equalising of ambition and energy.’[^5-8]

***

扁鵲遂飲二人毒酒
迷死三日
Then P’ien Ch’iao gave the two men drugged wine,
and they lost consciousness for three days.

剖胸
探心
He cut open their breasts,
pulled out their hearts,
易
而置之
投以神藥
exchanged them,
put them back,
and applied a magic medicine.

既悟
如初
When they woke up
they were as well as before.

二人辭歸
The two men took their leave and went off home.

於是公扈反齊嬰之室

妻子弗識
Thereupon Kung Hu returned to Ch’i Ying’s house
and took possession of his wife and children,
who did not recognise him.

齊嬰亦反公扈之室
有其妻子
妻子亦弗識
Ch’i Ying likewise returned to Kung Hu’s house
and took possession of his wife and children,
who also did not recognise him.

二室因相與訟
求辨於扁鵲
So the two families went to law against each other,
and called on P’ien Ch’iao to explain.

扁鵲辨其所由
訟乃已
P’ien Ch’iao explained the cause,
and the litigants were satisfied.

[^5-8]: According to Chinese conceptions,
mental functions are located in the heart instead of the brain;
on the other hand the _ch’i_ (breath, vitality, energy)

匏巴鼓琴
而鳥舞
魚躍
When Hu Pa played the lute,
the birds danced
and the fishes bounded.

鄭師文聞之
棄家
從師襄游
Wen of Cheng heard this story,
and left his family
to travel as an apprentice with Music-master Hsiang.

柱指鈞弦
三年不成章
He would lay his fingers on the strings to tune them
but for three years did not finish a piece.

***

師襄曰
子可以歸矣
‘You may as well go home,’
said Music-master Hsiang.

***

師文舍其琴歎曰
Wen put aside his lute with a sigh and answered:

***

文非弦之不能鈞
非章之不能成
‘It is not the strings that I cannot tune,
nor the piece that I cannot finish.

文所存者不在弦
所志者不在聲
What I have in mind is not in the strings,
what I am aiming at is not in the notes.

內不得於心
外不應於器
Unless I grasp it inwardly in my heart,
it will not answer from the instrument outside me.

故不敢發手而動弦
That is why I dare not put out my hand to stir the strings.

且小假之以觀其後
Let me stay a little longer and see if I do better later.’

***

无幾何
復見師襄
Soon afterwards
he saw Music-master Hsiang again.

***

師襄曰
子之琴何如
‘How are you getting on with the lute?’
Hsiang asked.

***

師文曰
得之矣
請嘗試之
‘I’ve got it,
let me show you.’

***

於是
當春
而叩商弦
以召南呂
Then,
during the spring,
he touched the Autumn string
and called up the note of the eighth month;[^5-9]
涼風揔至
草木成實
a cool wind came suddenly,
and fruit ripened on the bushes and trees.

及秋
而叩角弦
以激夾鐘
When autumn came
he touched the Spring string
and aroused the note of the second month;
溫風徐迴
草木發榮
a warm breeze whirled gently,
and the bushes and trees burst into flower.

當夏
而叩羽弦
以召黃鐘
During the summer
he touched the Winter string
and called up the note of the eleventh month;
霜雪交下
川池暴沍
frost and snow fell together
and the rivers and lakes abruptly froze.

及冬
而叩徵弦
以激蕤賓
When winter came
he touched the Summer string,
and aroused the note of the fifth month;
陽光熾烈
堅冰立散
the sunshine burned fiercely
and the hard ice melted at once.

將終
命宮
而揔四弦
When he was coming to the end
he announced the Kung string
and played the other four together;
則景風翔
慶雲浮
a fortunate wind soared,
auspicious clouds drifted,
甘露降
澧泉涌
the sweet dew fell,
the fresh springs bubbled.

***

師襄乃撫心
高蹈
曰
Then Music-master Hsiang slapped his chest
and stepped high,
saying:

***

微矣
子之彈也
‘Sublime,
your playing!

雖師曠
之清角
Even the Music-master K’uang
performing the _ch’ing-chiao_ music,
鄒衍
之吹律
亡以加之
and Tsou Yen
blowing the pitch-tubes,[^5-10]
had nothing to add to this.

彼將挾
琴執管
而從子之後耳
They would have to put their lutes under their arms,
take their pipes in their hands,
and follow behind you.’

[^5-9]: Chinese music has a pentatonic scale
in which the notes
(excluding the first, Kung)
are associated with the four seasons.
Its absolute pitch depends on semitones
blown through twelve pitch-tubes of standard lengths,
associated with the twelve months.
Each piece of music prescribes
the semitone to which the Kung string is to be tuned.

[^5-10]: K’uang’s performance of the _ch’ing-chiao_
caused a drought which lasted three years.
Tsou Yen,
by blowing the pitch-tubes,
warmed the climate of a country in the far North.

‘Once a woman named Erh of Han

while travelling East to Ch’i.

過雍門

She entered the capital through the Concord Gate,
and traded her songs for a meal.

既去
而餘音繞梁欐
三日不絕
When she left,
the lingering notes curled round the beams of the gate
and did not die away for three days;
左右以其人弗去
the by-standers thought that she was still there.

***

過逆旅
逆旅人辱之
‘She passed an inn,
where the landlord insulted her.

韓娥因曼聲哀哭
She therefore wailed mournfully in long-drawn-out notes;
一里
老幼
and all the people in the quarter,
old and young,
悲愁
垂涕相對
三日不食
looked at each other sadly
with the tears dripping down their faces,
and could not eat for three days.

遽而追之
They hurried after her and brought her back;
娥還復為曼聲長歌
and again she sang them a long ballad in drawn-out notes.

一里
長幼
The people of the whole quarter,
old and young,
喜躍抃舞
弗能自禁
忘向之悲也
could not help skipping with joy
and dancing to handclaps,
forgetting that they had been sad just before.

乃厚賂發之
Afterwards they sent her away with rich presents.

故
雍門之人
至今
‘That is why
even today
the people of Concord Gate

It was all made

leather, wood, glue and lacquer,
coloured white, black, red and blue.

on the inside
the liver, gall,
heart, lungs,

spleen, kidneys,
intestines and stomach,
外則
筋骨
on the outside
the muscles, bones,
支節
皮毛
limbs, joints,
skin, teeth and hair,
皆假物也

were all artificial,
but complete without exception.

合會復
如初見
When they were put together,
the thing was again as he had seen it before.

王試廢其心

The King tried taking out its heart,
and the mouth could not speak;
廢其肝
則目不能視
tried taking out its liver,
and the eyes could not see;

‘Is it then possible
for human skill
to achieve as much as the Creator?’

***

詔貳車載之

He had it loaded into the second of his cars,
and took it back with him.

***

夫班輸之雲梯

Kung-shu Pan’s ladder which reached the clouds,
Mo-tzǔ’s flying kite,
seemed to them the utmost of which men are capable.

聞偃師之巧
When their disciples Tung-men Chia
and Ch’in Ku-li
heard of Yen-shih’s skill,
以告二子
二子終身
不敢語藝
而時執規矩
they told the two philosophers,
who never dared to speak again of their accomplishments
to the end of their lives,
and always carried compass and square.[^5-11]

[^5-11]: Chang Chan (4th century A.D.) comments:
‘Recently there have been people who say
that man’s intelligence is produced through a mechanism.
Why?
The achievements of Creation are extremely subtle,
so that all the myriad varieties of things are developed,
and their activities are boundless.
Human techniques are rude and clumsy,
and all they do is crudely move about
things already fully shaped (cf. p. 65 above).
But if human skill could be perfected
it would hardly fall short of Creation.’
But he is unwilling to find the same idea here.
‘How can it mean that a thing does not have a spirit controlling it?
This is very much mistaken.’

    It has been suggested that the story
may be based on a very similar Indian story
of an automaton in the Buddhist _Sheng-ching_,
translated into Chinese in A.D. 285.
(There is a French translation of this by E. Chavannes,
_Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues_, vol. 3, pp. 170-72.)

甘蠅
古之善射者
Kan Ying
was a great archer of ancient times.

彀弓
而獸伏
鳥下
When he drew his bow,
beasts lay on the ground
and birds flew down
without waiting for him to shoot.

弟子名飛衛
學射於甘蠅
而巧過其師
A disciple named Fei Wei
learned archery from Kan Ying,
and his skill surpassed his master’s.[^5-12]

紀昌者又
學射於飛衛
Chi Ch’ang in his turn
was learning archery from Fei Wei.

***

飛衛曰
Fei Wei told him:

‘You must learn not to blink
before you can start talking about archery.’

***

紀昌歸
偃臥其妻之機下
以目承牽〼[^rse-5-3]
Chi Ch’ang went home
and lay down on his back under his wife’s loom,
with his eye next to the pedal.

二年之後
雖錐末倒眥
而不瞬也
以告飛衛
After two years
he did not blink
even when the sharp point
dropped to the corner of his eye.

飛衛曰
He told Fei Wei,
who replied:

***

未也
‘It won’t do yet.

必學視而後可
I shall not be satisfied until you learn how to look.

視小如大
視微如著

Come and tell me
when you can see the small as though it were big,
the faint as though it were distinct.’

以氂
懸虱於牖
Chi Ch’ang
hung a flea at his window
by a hair from a yak’s tail,
南面

and watched it from a distance
with the sun behind it.

旬日之閒
浸大也
Within ten days
it was growing larger;
三年之後
如車輪焉
at the end of three years
it was as big as a cartwheel.

以覩餘物
皆丘山也
When he observed other things in the same way,
they were all hills and mountains.

乃
以燕角之弧
朔蓬之簳
射之
Then
he shot at it
with a bow tipped with horn from Yen
and an arrow of _p’eng_ from the North,
貫虱之心
而懸不絕
and pierced the flea’s heart
without snapping the thread.

以告飛衛
飛衛高蹈拊膺
曰汝得之矣
He told Fei Wei,
who stepped high and slapped his chest,
saying ‘You’ve got it.’

***

紀昌既
盡衛之術
After Chi Ch’ang had learned
all that Fei Wei could teach him,
計
天下之敵己者
一人而已
he judged
that only one man in the world
was a match for himself.

乃謀殺飛衛
So he planned to kill Fei Wei.

相遇於野
二人交射
The two men met in the moorlands
and shot at each other;
中路矢鋒相觸
而墜於地
而塵不揚
their arrow-heads collided in mid-air
and dropped to the ground
without raising the dust.

飛衛之矢先窮
Fei Wei was the first to run out of arrows.

紀昌遺一矢
Chi Ch’ang had one arrow left;
既發
飛衛以棘刺之端扞之
而无差焉
when he shot it,
Fei Wei interposed the tip of a bramble thorn
and did not miss.

於是二子泣而投弓
相拜於塗
請為父子
Thereupon the two men threw aside their bows weeping,
bowed down to each other on the road,
and asked to become father and son.

剋臂以誓
不得告術於人
They drew blood from their arms and took an oath
never to reveal their arts to other men.

[^rse-5-3]: 挺 in _Sibu congkan_
and emended in _Concordance_
to something I can’t find,
but that looks like (⿱入走).

[^5-12]: A story attributed to the _Lieh-tzu_
in the old encyclopedia _T’ai-p’ing yü-lan_ (ch. 350)
perhaps originally stood in the position of this sentence:

    ‘Fei Wei learned archery from Kan Ying.
He was skilled in all his master’s methods,
except that Kan Ying did not teach him
his method of catching arrows between his teeth.
Wei secretly took an arrow and shot at Ying.
Ying caught the arrowhead between his teeth
and shot it back at Wei.
Wei ran round a tree,
and the arrow swerved round the tree after him.’

造父之師
曰泰豆氏
The charioteer Tsao-fu’s teacher
was called T’ai-tou.

造父之始從習御也
執禮甚卑
泰豆三年不告
When Tsao-fu first practised charioteering under him,
he behaved with extreme humility,
but for three years T’ai-tou told him nothing.

造父執禮愈謹
乃告之曰
He behaved even more punctiliously,
and finally T’ai-tou told him:

***

古詩言
‘An old poem says:

> 良弓之子
‘“The son of a good bow-maker
必先為箕
Must begin by making baskets.
良冶之子
The son of a good blacksmith
必先為裘
Must begin by making chisels.”

***

汝先觀吾趣
‘First watch me run;
趣如吾然後
六轡可持
六馬可御
you will not be able
to hold six bridles
and drive six horses
until you can run like me.’

***

造父曰
唯命所從
‘I will obey whatever you command,’
Tsao-fu answered.

***

泰豆乃立木為塗
僅可容足
計步而置之
Then T’ai-tou set up a row of posts,
just big enough to stand on,
the length of a stride apart.

履之而行
趣走往還
无跌失也
He ran backwards and forwards
stepping from one to the next
without stumbling.

造父學之
三曰盡其巧
Tsao-fu practised it
and could do it perfectly in three days.

***

泰豆歎曰
子何其敏也
‘How nimble you are!’
T’ai-tou said.

得之捷乎
‘You have picked it up quickly!

凡所御者
亦如此也
Charioteering
is just the same.

曩汝之行
得之於足
應之於心
When you were running just now,
you responded with your mind
to what you felt in your feet.

推於御也
齊輯
乎轡銜之際
Applying this to charioteering,
you must control the bridle
from the point where it meets the bit,
而急緩
乎脣吻之和
and pull tight or slacken
feeling the corners of the lips;
正度
乎胸臆之中
decision must come
from within your breast
而執節
乎掌握之閒
and execution
from within the palm of your hand.

內得
於中心
What you sense within
in your innermost heart
而外合
於馬志
will accord outside
with the horse’s temper.

是故能
In this way you will be able
進退
履繩
而旋曲中規
to advance and withdraw
treading a stretched cord,
and wheel round as exactly as a compass,
取道
致遠
而氣力有餘
take the road
on far journeys
and have strength and breath to spare;
誠得其術也
you will truly have mastered this art.

***

得之於銜
應之於轡
‘If you respond with the bridle
to what you feel in the bit,
得之於轡
應之於手
with the hand
to what you feel in the bridle,
得之於手
應之於心
with the mind
to what you feel in the hand,
則不以目視
不以策驅
then you will see without eyes
and urge without a goad;

心閑體正
六轡不亂
relaxed in mind and straight in posture,
holding six bridles without confusing them,
而二十四蹄
所投无差
you will place the twenty-four hooves
exactly where you want them,
廻旋
進退
莫不中節
and swing round,
advance and withdraw
with perfect precision.

然後
Only then
will you be able to drive
輿輪之外
可使无餘轍
carving a rut
no wider than the chariot’s wheel,
馬蹄之外
可使无餘地
on a cliff which drops
at the edge of the horse’s hoof,
未嘗覺山谷之嶮
原隰之夷
視之一也
never noticing that mountains and valleys are steep
and plains and marshland are flat,
seeing them as all the same.

吾術窮矣
This is all I have to teach;
汝其識之
remember it!’

魏黑卵
以暱嫌
殺
丘邴章
Hei Luan of Liang
had a private grudge against
Ch’iu Ping-chang
and killed him.

丘邴章之子來丹
謀報父之讎
The dead man’s son Lai-tan
sought means to avenge his father.

丹氣甚猛
形甚露
Lai-tan had a fierce temper
but a skinny body;
計粒而食
順風而趨
he ate his rice counting the grains,
and was too weak to run against the wind.

雖怒
不能稱兵
以報之
In spite of his anger,
he was incapable of taking up arms
to revenge himself;
恥
假力於人
but he was ashamed
to depend on other men’s strength,
誓
手劍
以屠黑卵
and swore
to butcher Hei Luan
with his own hand and sword.

黑卵悍志
絕眾
Hei Luan had a savage disposition
quite out of the ordinary,
力抗百夫
筋骨皮肉
非人類也
strength equal to a hundred men,
and muscles, bones, skin and flesh
which were more than human.

延頸承刃
披胸受矢
He would stretch out his neck to meet the sword,
bare his breast to receive the arrows;
鋩鍔摧屈
而體无痕撻
and the edge would bend and the points break
without leaving a scar or a scratch on his body.

負其材力
視來丹
猶雛鷇也
Proud of his strength,
he treated Lai-tan
as though he were a chick or a fledgeling.

***

來丹之友申他曰
Lai-tan’s friend Shen T’o said to him:

***

子怨黑卵至矣
‘You utterly hate Hei Luan.

黑卵之易子過矣
The way he slights you is beyond endurance.

將奚謀焉
How are you going to deal with him?’

***

來丹垂涕曰
願子為我謀
‘I wish you would advise me,’
Lai-tan answered, weeping.

***

申他曰
吾聞
衛孔周其祖
得殷帝之寶劍
‘I have heard
that the grandfather of K’ung Chou of Wei
won the treasured swords of the Yin Emperors.

一童子
服之
卻三軍之眾
A single small boy
with one of these swords at his side
could drive back a whole army.

奚不請焉
Why not ask him for them?’

***

來丹遂適衛
見孔周
So Lai-tan went to Wei
and saw K’ung Chou.

執僕御之禮
請先
納妻子
後言所欲
Before making his request,
he addressed K’ung Chou
with the politeness of a servant or a groom,
and offered him his wife and children as slaves.

***

孔周曰
吾有三劍
‘I have three swords,’
K’ung Chou said.

唯子所擇
皆不能殺人
‘Choose whichever you like,
but none of them can kill anyone.

且先言其狀
Let me start by describing them for you.

一曰含光
The first is called “Container of Light”.

視之不可見
運之不知有
Look for it and it is invisible,
swing it and you cannot tell it is there.

其所觸也
泯然无際
When it hits something
there is no cut whatever;
經物
而物不覺
it passes right through
without the victim noticing.

二曰承影
The second is called “Receiver of Shadows”.

將旦
昧爽之交
日夕昏明之際
In the twilight just before dawn,
between light and darkness
when the sun goes in,
北面而察之
淡淡焉若有物存
莫識其狀
if you scrutinise it with your back to the sun,
there is a faint semblance of something there,
but no one can recognise its shape.

其所觸也
竊竊然有聲
When it hits something
there is a hissing sound,
經物
而物不疾也
and it passes right through
without hurting the victim.

三曰宵練
The third is called “Tempered by Night”.

方晝則見影
而不見光
By day you see its shadow
but not its glitter,
方夜見光
而不見形
by night its glitter
but not its shape.

其觸物也
騞然而過
隨過隨合
When it hits something,
it passes through with a tearing sound,
and the wound closes as soon as it has passed;
覺疾
而不血刃焉
the victim feels pain
but there is no stain on the blade.

此三寶者
傳之十三世矣
而无施於事
These three treasures
have been handed down through thirteen generations
without being put to use:

匣而藏之
未嘗啟封
I have kept them in their cases
and never broken the seals.’

***

來丹曰
雖然
吾必請其下者
‘Nevertheless,’
said Lai-tan,
‘I must ask you for the third one.’

***

孔周乃
歸其妻子
與齋七日
Then K’ung Chou
made him take back his wife and children,
fasted with him for seven days,
晏陰之閒
跪
而授其下劍
and at twilight on the seventh day
knelt down
and presented the least of his three swords.

來丹再拜
受之
以歸
Lai-tan prostrated himself twice,
took it,
and returned home.

***

來丹
遂執劍
從黑卵
So Lai-tan
went looking for Hei Luan
with the sword in his hand.

時黑卵之醉
偃於牖下
自頸至腰三斬之
Picking a time when Hei Luan
was lying drunk under his window,
he slashed him three times from neck to waist.

黑卵不覺
Hei Luan did not wake up.

***

來丹以黑卵之死
趣而退
Lai-tan thought that his enemy was dead
and hurried out.

遇黑卵之子於門
擊之三下
He met Hei Luan’s son at the gate
and struck him three times;
如投虛
it was like beating the air.

黑卵之子方笑曰
Hei Luan’s son asked with a smile:

***

汝何蚩
而三招予
‘Why did you wave your hand at me three times
in that funny way?’

***

來丹知
劍之不能殺人也
歎而歸
Lai-tan understood
that the sword could not kill a man,
and went home sighing.

黑卵既醒
怒其妻曰
After Hei Luan sobered up,
he said angrily to his wife:

***

醉而露我
‘You didn’t cover me up when I was drunk;
使我嗌疾
而腰急
it has given me a sore throat
and my waist hurts.’

***

其子曰
疇昔來丹之來
遇我於門
‘When Lai-tan came yesterday,’
his son said,

三招我
亦使我體疾
而支彊
‘he waved his hand at me three times,
and it gave me a pain in my body too,
and my arms and legs are stiff.

彼其厭我哉
He must have put a curse on me!’

---

周穆王
大征
西戎
When King Mu of Chou
made his great expedition
against the Jung tribes of the West,
西戎獻
錕鋙之劍
火浣之布
they presented him with
a knife from K’un-wu
and a fire-proof cloth.

其劍長尺有咫
練鋼赤刃
The knife was one foot eight inches long
with a red blade of tempered steel;
用之切玉如切泥焉
cutting jade with it was as easy as cutting mud.

火浣之布
浣之必投於火
The fire-proof cloth
could be washed only by throwing it into fire;
布則火色
垢則布色
the cloth turned the colour of the fire,
the dirt turned the colour of ash;
出火而振之
皓然疑乎雪
take it from the fire and shake it,
and it glistened like snow.

***

皇子以為无此物
傳之者妄
A Prince thought there were no such things,
that the tradition was mistaken.

蕭叔曰
皇子果於自信
果於誣理哉
Hsiao Shu said:
‘How obstinate the Prince is in trusting his own judgement,
how obstinate in his false reasoning!’ [^5-13]

[^5-13]: _Huang-tzǔ_,
translated ‘Prince’,
could also be taken as a proper name.
But it is likely that the author,
although professing to be writing much earlier,
wishes his readers to be reminded of Ts’ao P’i,
who became the Emperor Wen (220-226) of the Wei dynasty.
Ts’ao P’i doubted the records of jade-cutting knives and fire-proof cloth
sent as tribute to earlier Emperors by Western tribes.
He was confounded by the arrival of both shortly afterwards.

    The commentator Chang Chan notes:
‘Concluding the chapter with this section
explaining the jade-cutting knife and fire-proof cloth is to show that,
since there is nothing fabulous about these two things,
everything recounted earlier is fact also.’
