## 仲尼 Confucius

仲尼閒居
Confucius was out of office.

子貢入侍
Tzǔ-kung came in to wait on him;
而有憂色
Confucius looked careworn.

子貢不敢問
出告顏回
Tzǔ-kung did not dare to ask questions,
but went out and told Yen Hui.

***

顏回援琴而歌
Yen Hui sang plucking the lute.

孔子聞之
果
召回入問曰
Confucius heard him,
and,
as Yen Hui was hoping,
called him in to inquire.

***

若奚獨樂
‘Why do you rejoice at a time like this?’

***

回曰
夫子奚獨憂
‘Why is my Master so careworn?’

***

孔子曰
先言爾志
‘First let me hear what you have to say.’

***

曰
吾昔聞之夫子曰
‘Master, once I heard you say:

樂天
知命
故不憂
“Rejoice in heaven
and know destiny,
and so be free of care.”

回所以樂也
That is why I rejoice.’

***

孔子愀然有閒曰
Confucius looked solemn for a moment.

***

有是言哉
‘Did I say that?

汝之意失矣
But you understand it in too narrow a way.

此吾昔日之言爾
請以今言為正也
That is merely something I said on a particular occasion;
please correct it by what I say now.

汝徒知
樂天
知命
之无憂
You know only
the careless side of
rejoicing in heaven
and knowing destiny,
未知
樂天
知命
之有憂之大也
and still do not know
that they
are also the greatest of cares.

今告若其實
Now let me tell you the truth of the matter.

***

脩一身
任窮達
‘The training of your personal character,
indifferent to failure and success;
知去來之
非我
亡變
亂於心慮
awareness that the events
which have happened and will happen to you
do not depend on yourself,
and should not disturb your thoughts;
爾之所謂
樂天
知命
之无憂也
this is what you understand by
the carelessness of
rejoicing in heaven
and knowing destiny.

曩
吾脩
詩書
正禮樂
But not long ago,
when I edited
the _Songs_ and the _History_,
and corrected rites and music,
將以治天下
遺來世
my aim was to restore order to the Empire
and bequeath this order to future generations;
非但脩一身
治魯國
而已
it was not merely
to train my personal character
and order my own state of Lu.

而魯之君臣
日失其序
仁義益衰
情性益薄
Yet the ministers of Lu
daily usurped more of their prince’s power,
morals steadily deteriorated,
the good inclinations in man’s nature grew weaker and weaker.

此道不行一國與當年
其如天下與來世矣
If this Way does not work in one state and the present time,
what can we expect of the Empire and the generations to come?

吾始知
詩書
禮樂
无救於治亂
I knew for the first time that
the _Songs_ and _History_,
rites and music,
are of no help in restoring order;
而未知所以革之之方
but still I did not know any method to replace them.

此樂天
知命者
之所憂也
This is what the man who rejoices in heaven
and knows destiny
has to care about.

***

雖然
吾得之矣
‘Nevertheless,
I have found it.

夫樂
而知者
This “rejoicing”
and this “knowing”
非古人之所謂
樂知也
are not what the men of old meant
by the two words.

无樂
无知
Rejoicing in nothing
and knowing nothing
是真樂
真知
are the true rejoicing
and the true knowledge;
故无所不樂
无所不知
and so you rejoice in everything,
know everything,
无所不憂
无所不為
care about everything,
do everything.

詩書
禮樂
何棄之有
革之何為
Why should we discard
the _Songs_ and _History_,
rites and music,
and what is the point in replacing them?’

***

顏回北面拜手曰
Yen Hui faced North and bowed, saying:

***

回亦得之矣
‘I too have found it.’

***

出告子貢
He went out and told Tzǔ-kung.

子貢茫然自失
Tzǔ-kung lost himself in thought.

歸家淫思七日
不寢不食
以至骨立
He returned home and meditated deeply for seven days,
neither eating nor sleeping,
until his bones stood out.

顏回重往喻之
Yen Hui went a second time to explain to him.

乃反丘門
絃歌
誦書
終身不輟
Then Tzǔ-kung went back to follow Confucius again,
and to the end of his life never gave up
playing the lute,
singing and intoning books.

陳大夫
聘魯
私見叔孫氏
A high official of Ch’en
on a state visit to Lu
called privately on Shu-sun.

***

叔孫氏曰
吾國有聖人
‘We have a sage in our country,’
Shu-sun told him.

***

曰
非孔丘邪
‘You mean Confucius,
I suppose?’

***

曰
是也
‘I do.’

***

何以知其聖乎
‘How do you know he is a sage?’

***

叔孫氏曰
吾常聞之顏回曰
孔丘能廢心而用形
‘I once heard his disciple Yen Hui say
that Confucius is able to discard his mind and use his body.’

***

陳大夫曰
吾國亦有聖人
‘We have a sage in our country too.

子弗知乎
Don’t you know about him?’

***

曰
聖人孰謂
‘What sage do you mean?’

***

曰
老聃之弟子
有亢倉子者
‘We have a disciple of Lao-tzǔ
called Keng-sang-tzǔ.

得聃之道
能以耳視
而目聽
He has grasped the Way of Lao-tzǔ
and is able to look with his ears
and listen with his eyes.’

***

魯侯聞之大驚
使上卿厚禮而致之
When the Marquis of Lu heard of this sage he was astounded,
and sent a great noble to bring him to Lu with the highest honours.

亢倉子應聘而至
魯侯卑辭請
問之
Keng-sang-tzǔ arrived in response to the invitation,
and the Marquis asked in the humblest language
to be allowed to question him.

***

亢倉子曰
傳之者妄
‘The rumour is false,’
said Keng-sang-tzǔ.

我能視聽
不用耳目
‘I can look and listen
without using eyes and ears.

不能易
耳目之用
I cannot exchange
the functions of eyes and ears.’

***

魯侯曰
此增異矣
‘But this is even stranger.

其道奈何
What sort of Way is this?

寡人終願聞之
I cannot wait to hear.’

***

亢倉子曰
我體合於心
心合於氣
‘My body is in accord with my mind,
my mind with my energies,
氣合於神
神合於无
my energies with my spirit,
my spirit with Nothing.

其有介然之有
唯然之音
Whenever the minutest existing thing
or the faintest sound affects me,
雖遠在八荒之外
近在眉睫之內
我必知之
whether it is far away beyond the eight borderlands,
or close at hand between my eyebrows and eyelashes,
I am bound to know it.

乃
不知是我
However,
I do not know whether I
七孔
四支
之所覺
perceived it with
the seven holes in my head
and my four limbs,
心腹
六藏
之所知
or knew it through my
heart and belly
and internal organs.

其自知而已矣
It is simply self-knowledge.’

***

魯侯大悅
The Marquis of Lu was delighted.

他日以告仲尼
仲尼笑而不荅
On another day he told Confucius,
who smiled without answering.

商太宰
見孔子曰
The chief minister of Sung
visited Confucius and asked him:

***

丘聖者歟
‘Are you a sage?’

***

孔子曰
聖則丘何敢
‘How can I claim to be a sage?

然則丘博學多識者也
I am merely a man who has studied widely
and remembered much.’

***

商太宰曰
三王聖者歟
‘Were the Three Kings sages?’

***

孔子曰
三王
善任智勇者
‘The Three Kings
were good at employing wisdom and courage;
聖則丘不知
whether they were sages I do not know.’

***

曰
五帝聖者歟
‘Were the Five Emperors sages?’

***

孔子曰
五帝
善任仁義者
‘The Five Emperors
were good at employing morality;
聖則丘弗知
whether they were sages I do not know.’

***

曰
三皇聖者歟
‘Were the Three Highnesses sages?’

***

孔子曰
三皇
善任因時者
‘The Three Highnesses
were good at adapting themselves to the times;
聖則丘弗知
whether they were sages I do not know.’

***

商太宰大駭曰
The chief minister of Sung said in amazement:

***

然則孰者為聖
‘Then who do you think is a sage?’

***

孔子動容有閒
Confucius’ expression changed for a moment.

***

曰
西方之人
有聖者焉
‘Among the people of the Western regions
there is a sage.

不治
而不亂
He does not govern,
yet there is no disorder;
不言
而自信
does not speak,
yet is trusted spontaneously;
不化
而自行
does not reform,
yet his influence prevails spontaneously.

蕩蕩乎
民无能名焉
He is so great
that none of his people can give a name to him.

丘疑其為聖
弗知
I suspect that he is a sage,
but I do not know
真為聖歟
真不聖歟
whether he truly is
or not.’

***

商太宰嘿然心計曰
The chief minister thought silently in his heart:

***

孔丘欺我哉
‘Confucius is deceiving me!’[^4-1]

[^4-1]: There has been no true sage
since the institutions of government began.
Since the earliest Emperors there has been a continual degeneration,
the rulers first spontaneously answering the needs of the times,
then standardising a rigid morality,
finally relying on cleverness and force.
The sage in the West is presumably Lao-tzǔ,
who disappeared into the far West
where he no doubt realised the ideal society
which was impossible in China.
But the reference to the sage in the West is mysterious;
Buddhists, and later Christians,
very naturally took the opportunity
to identify him with Buddha or Christ.

子夏問孔子曰
Tzǔ-hsia asked Confucius:

***

顏回之為人奚若
‘What sort of man is Yen Hui?’

***

子曰
回之仁
賢於丘也
‘For kindness,
he is a better man than I am.’

***

曰
子貢之為人奚若
‘What about Tzǔ-kung?’

***

子曰
賜之辯
賢於丘也
‘For eloquence,
he is a better man than I am.’

***

曰
子路之為人奚若
‘Tzǔ-lu?’

***

子曰
由之勇
賢於丘也
‘For courage,
he is a better man than I am.’

***

曰
子張之為人奚若
‘Tzǔ-chang?’

***

子曰
師之莊
賢於丘也
‘For dignity,
he is a better man than I am.’

***

子夏避席而問曰
Tzǔ-hsia rose from his mat and asked:

***

然則四子者何為事夫子
‘Then why do these four serve you?’

***

曰
居
吾語汝
‘Sit down,
I will tell you.

夫回能仁
而不能反
Yen Hui can be kind,
but cannot check the impulse when it will do no good.

賜能辯
而不能訥
Tzǔ-kung can be eloquent,
but cannot hold his tongue.

由能勇
而不能怯
Tzǔ-lu can be brave
but cannot be cautious.

師能莊
而不能同
Tzǔ-chang can be dignified,
but cannot unbend in company.

兼四者子之有以易吾
吾弗許也
Even if I could have the virtues of the four men all together,
I should be unwilling to exchange them for my own.

此其所以事吾而不貳也
This is why they serve me without misgivings.’

子列子既師壺丘子林
友伯昏瞀人
乃居南郭
After Lieh-tzǔ had studied under Hu-tzǔ
and befriended Po-hun We-jen,
he returned to live in South Suburb.

從之處者
百數而不及
Many people settled down there as his followers,
more than you could count in hundreds.

雖然
子列子亦微焉
朝朝相與辯
无不聞
However,
Lieh-tzǔ did not find them too many,
and argued with them every morning,
listening to anyone who had something to say.

而與南郭子連牆二十年
不相謁請
But he lived next door to Nan-kuo-tzǔ[^4-2] for twenty years,
without either of them inviting or calling on the other.

相遇於道
目若不相見者
When they chanced to meet on the road,
their eyes seemed not to see each other;
門之徒役以為
子列子與南郭子有敵
不疑
and the disciples thought
that beyond doubt
Lieh-tzǔ and Nan-kuo-tzǔ were enemies.

***

有自楚來者
問子列子曰
先生與南郭子奚敵
A man who had come from Ch’u
asked Lieh-tzǔ
why he and Nan-kuo-tzǔ were enemies.

***

子列子曰
南郭子貌充心虛
‘Nan-kuo-tzǔ’s face is full but his mind void,’
Lieh-tzǔ answered.

耳无聞
目无見
口无言
‘His ears hear nothing,
his eyes see nothing,
his mouth says nothing,
心无知
形无惕
his mind knows nothing,
his body never alters.

往將奚為
What is the point in visiting him?

雖然
試與汝偕往
However,
I may as well go along with you to take a look at him.’

***

閱弟子四十人同行
Forty disciples went with him.

見南郭子
果若欺魄焉
而不可與接
They saw Nan-kuo-tzǔ,
who did indeed seem like a clay image
with which it was impossible to make contact.

顧視子列子
形神不相偶
而不可與群
When they looked round at Lieh-tzǔ,
his spirit was out of connection with his body
and no communion was possible with Lieh-tzǔ either.

***

南郭子俄
而指子列子之
弟子末行者
與言
衎衎然若專直
而存雄者
Suddenly Nan-kuo-tzǔ
pointed to the man
at the very rear of the file of Lieh-tzǔ’s disciples
and began talking to him,
hectoring him like a bigot
who is determined always to be in the right.

子列子之徒駭之
反舍咸有疑色
The disciples were startled by this,
and all had doubtful expressions when they returned to the house.

子列子曰
But Lieh-tzǔ told them:

***

得意者无言
進知者亦无言
‘Whoever gets the idea says nothing,
whoever knows it all also says nothing.

用无言為言亦言
无知為知亦知
Whether you think that saying nothing
is saying or not saying,
无言與不言
无知與不知
whether you think that knowing nothing
is knowing or not knowing,
亦言
亦知
you are still saying
and still knowing.

亦无所不言
亦无所不知
But there is nothing that he either does not say
or says,
亦无所言
亦无所知
nothing that he either does not know
or knows.

如斯而已
This is all there is to it;
汝奚妄駭哉
why were you needlessly startled?’

[^4-2]: The name means ‘Philosopher of South Suburb’.

子列子之學也
三年之後
心不敢念是非
口不敢言利害
When Lieh-tzǔ was studying under Old Shang,
after three years
his mind no longer dared to think of right and wrong,
his mouth no longer dared to speak of benefit and harm;
始得老商
一眄而已
and it was only then
that he got as much as a glance from Old Shang.

五年之後
心更念是非
口更言利害
After five years,
his mind was again thinking of right and wrong,
his mouth was again speaking of benefit and harm;
老商始一
解顏而笑
and for the first time Old Shang’s
face relaxed in a smile.

七年之後
從心之所念
更无是非
After seven years,
he thought of whatever came into his mind
without any longer distinguishing between right and wrong,
從口之所言
更无利害
said whatever came into his mouth
without any longer distinguishing between benefit and harm;
夫子始一
引吾並席而坐
and for the first time
the Master pulled him over to sit with him on the same mat.

九年之後
橫心之所念
橫口之所言
After nine years,
he thought without restrain of whatever came into his mind
and said without restraint whatever came into his mouth
亦不知我之是非利害歟
亦不知彼之是非利害歟
without knowing whether the right and wrong, benefit and harm,
were his own or another’s.

外內進矣
而後
Only then,
when he had come to the end
of everything inside him and outside him,
眼如耳
耳如鼻
鼻如口
his eyes became like his ears,
his ears like his nose,
his nose like his mouth;
无不同
everything was the same.

心凝形釋
骨肉都融
His mind concentrated and his body relaxed,
bones and flesh fused completely,
不覺
形之所倚
足之所履
he did not notice
what his body leaned against
and his feet trod,
心之所念
言之所藏
what his mind thought
and his words contained.

如斯而已
則理无所隱矣
If you can only be like this,
none of the principles of things will be hidden from you.[^4-3]

[^4-3]: This passage is repeated from ch. 2 (p. 36 above).
But the two versions have different conclusions,
relating the story to the different themes of the two chapters,
power and knowledge.

初子列子好游
Before this Lieh-tzǔ liked travel.

壺丘子曰
Hu-tzǔ asked him:

***

禦寇好游
游何所好
‘What is it you like so much
about travel?’

***

列子曰
游之樂
所玩无故
‘The joy of travel
is that the things which amuse you never remain the same.

人之游也觀其所見
我之游也觀其所變
Other men travel to contemplate the sights,
I travel to contemplate the way things change.

游乎游乎
未有能辨其游者
There is travel and travel,
and I have still to meet someone who can tell the difference!’

***

壺丘子曰
禦寇之游固與人同歟
‘Is not your travel really the same as other men’s?

而曰固與人異歟
Would you insist there is really a difference?

凡所見
亦恆見其變
Anything at all that we see,
we always see changing.

玩彼物之无故
不知我亦无故
You are amused that other things never remain the same,
but do not know that you yourself never remain the same.

務外游
不知務內觀
You busy yourself with outward travel
and do not know how to busy yourself with inward contemplation.

外游者
求備於物
By outward travel
we seek what we lack in things outside us,
內觀者
取足於身
while by inward contemplation
we find sufficiency in ourselves.

取足於身
游之至也
The latter
is the perfect,
求備於物
游之不至也
the former
an imperfect kind of travelling.’

***

於是列子終身不出
自以為不知游
From this time Lieh-tzǔ never went out any more,
thinking that he did not understand travel.

壺丘子曰
Hu-tzǔ told him:

***

游其至乎
‘How perfect is travel!

至游者
不知所適
In perfect travel
we do not know where we are going,
至觀者
不知所眡
in perfect contemplation
we do not know what we are looking at.

物物皆游矣
物物皆觀矣
To travel over all things without exception,
contemplate all things without exception,
是我之所謂游
是我之所謂觀也
this is what I call travel
and contemplation.

故曰
That is why I say:

游其至矣乎
游其至矣乎
“How perfect is travel!”’

龍叔謂文摯曰
Lung Shu said to the physician Wen Chih:

***

子之術微矣
‘Your craft is subtle.

吾有疾
子能已乎
I have an illness,
can you cure it?’

***

文摯曰
唯命所聽
‘You have only to command.

然先言子所病之證
But first tell me the symptoms of your illness.’

***

龍叔曰
吾鄉譽不以為榮
國毀不以為辱
‘I do not think it an honour if the whole district praises me,
nor a disgrace if the whole state reviles me;
得而不喜
失而弗憂
I have no joy when I win,
no anxiety when I lose;
視生如死
視富如貧
I look in the same way at
life and death,
riches and poverty,
視人如豕
視吾如人
other men and pigs,
myself and other men;

處吾之家
如逆旅之舍
I dwell in my own house
as though lodging in an inn,
觀吾之鄉
如戎蠻之國
look out at my own neighbourhood
as though it were a foreign and barbarous country.

***

凡此眾疾
爵賞不能勸
刑罰不能威
‘Having all these ailments,
titles and rewards cannot induce me,
punishments and fines cannot awe me,
盛衰
利害不能易
哀樂不能移
prosperity and decline
and benefit and harm cannot change me,
joy and sorrow cannot influence me.

固不可
事國君
交親友
Consequently it is impossible for me
to serve my prince,
have dealings with my kindred and friends,
御妻子
制僕隸
manage my wife and children,
control my servants.

此奚疾哉
What illness is this?

奚方能已之乎
What art can cure it?’

***

文摯乃命龍叔
背明而立
Then Wen Chih ordered Lung Shu
to stand with his back to the light.

文摯自後
向明而望之
He himself stepped back
and examined Lung Shu from a distance facing the light.

既而曰
Finally he said:

***

嘻
‘Hmm.

吾見子之心矣
I see your heart.

方寸之地虛矣
幾聖人也
The place an inch square is empty,
you are almost a sage.

子心六孔流通
一孔不達
Six of the holes in your heart run into each other,
but one is stopped up.

今以聖智為疾者
或由此乎
Can this be the reason
why you now think the wisdom of a sage is an illness?

非吾淺術所能已也
My shallow craft can do nothing to cure it.’

---

无所由
而常生者
道也
To be born normally,
coming from nowhere,
is the Way.

由生
而生
故雖終
而不亡
常也
When a man follows a course consistent with life,
and lives,
so that although he dies when his term is up
he does not perish before his time,
this is normal;
由生
而亡
不幸也
to follow a course consistent with life
and perish before his time
is misfortune.

***

有所由
而常死者
亦道也
To die normally,
in accordance with your manner of life,
is also the Way.

由死
而死
故雖未終
而自亡者
亦常也
When a man follows a course which leads to death,
and dies,
so that he perishes by his own fault
even before his term is up,
this is also normal;
由死
而生
幸也
to live
after following a course which leads to death
is good luck.

***

故
无用而生
謂之道
Therefore
to be born depending on nothing
is called the Way,
用道得終
謂之常
and to live out your term depending on the Way
is called normal.

有所用而死者
亦謂之道
Death which depends on your manner of life
is also called the Way,
用道而得死者
亦謂之常
and premature death which depends on the Way
is also called normal.

***

季梁之死
楊朱望其門而歌
When Chi Liang died,
Yang Chu looked towards his gate and sang.

隨梧之死
楊朱撫其尸而哭
When Sui Wu died,
Yang Chu wept embracing his corpse.[^4-4]

隸人之生
隸人之死
眾人且歌
眾人且哭
But ordinary people sing when anyone is born
and weep when anyone dies.

[^4-4]: For Yang Chu and Chi Liang, cf. p. 128 below.
Chi Liang lived out his term ‘normally’,
Sui Wu died by ‘misfortune’.

目將眇者
先睹
秋毫
The eye is about to grow dim
when it can discern
the tip of a hair;
耳將聾者
先聞
蚋飛
the ear is about to go deaf
when it can hear
the wings of a gnat;

口將爽者
先辨
淄澠
the palate is about to deteriorate
when it can discriminate between
the waters of the Tzǔ and the Sheng;
鼻將窒者
先覺
焦朽
the nostrils are about to clog
when they can distinguish
scorched and rotten smells;

體將僵者
先亟
犇佚
the body is about to stiffen
when it delights
in sprinting;
心將迷者
先識
是非
the mind is about to go astray
when it can recognise
right and wrong.

故物不至者
則不反
Therefore if a thing does not reach its limit
it will not revert.

鄭之
圃澤多賢
東里多才
In Cheng
there were many men of worth in Pu-tse,
and many talented specialists in the East Quarter.

圃澤之役
有伯豐子者
行過東里
遇鄧析
When Pai-feng,
one of the disciples in Pu-tse,
was passing through the East Quarter,
he chanced on Teng Hsi.[^4-5]

鄧析顧其徒而笑曰
Teng Hsi looked round at his followers and smiled.

***

為若舞彼來者
奚若
‘What would you say
if I make that fellow coming towards us do a dance for you?’

***

其徒曰
所願知也
‘It would please us immensely,’
they answered.

***

鄧析謂伯豐子曰
Teng Hsi said to Pai-feng:

***

汝知養
養之義乎
受人養
‘Do you know
the difference between
being kept like a parent supported by his sons,
and being kept like a dog?

而不能自養者
犬豕之類也
Such creatures as dogs and pigs
are kept by man and cannot keep themselves;
養物
而物為我用者
人之力也
the effort of man
keeps these animals
and uses them for his own ends.

使汝之徒
食而飽
衣而息
執政之功也
If people like you
are well fed
and comfortably clothed,
you owe it to the administration.

長幼群聚
而為牢藉庖廚之物
奚異犬豕之類乎
Herded together old and young
as though you were animals for the sty or the kitchen,
how do you differ from the dogs and the pigs?’

***

伯豐子不應
伯豐子之從者
越次而進曰
Pai-feng did not answer,
but one of his disciples stepped out of the file,
came forward and said:

***

大夫不聞
齊魯之多機乎
‘Have you not heard
of the many skilled men in Ch’i and Lu?

有善治土木者
有善治金革者
Some are clever at working with clay or wood,

some are good singers or musicians,
others good scribes or diviners;
有善治軍旅者

But they cannot give each other positions

使之者无能
the men who give them positions lack their knowledge,
the men who tell them what to do lack their abilities,
而知之與能
為之使焉

are employed.

子奚矜焉
It is we who employ you administrators;
what have you to be conceited about?’

鄧析无以應
Teng Hsi was at a loss for an answer.

目其徒
而退
With a glance to his disciples,
he withdrew.

[^4-5]: Pai-feng was a disciple of Lieh-tzǔ (p. 20).
Lieh-tzǔ and his disciples lived as hermits in Pu-tse (Pu-t’ien),
the game preserve of Cheng (p. 17).
The Prime Minister Tzu-ch’an lived in the East Quarter (_Analects_ ch. 14/8);
among his employees was Teng Hsi,
who prepared the law-code of Cheng (p. 127).
It may be mentioned that Tzu-ch’an died in 522 B.C.,
and that in another story (p. 162)
Lieh-tzǔ outlives the minister Tzu-yang (died 398 B.C.).
The chronology of the _Lieh-tzǔ_ is quite vague;
within the period 600-300 B.C., anyone can meet anyone.

懦夫也
When the Earl of Kung-yi arrived,
the King examined his physique
and found him a puny fellow.

公儀伯曰
臣之力

‘My strong men,’
said the King,
looking displeased,
能裂犀兕之革
曳九牛之尾
猶憾其弱
‘can rip the hide of a rhinoceros,
and drag nine oxen by the tail,
but it still irks me that they are too weak.

而力聞天下
何也
How is it
that you are famous for your strength throughout the world?’

The Earl of Kung-yi breathed a long sigh,
withdrew from his mat,
and answered:

***

善哉王之問也
‘Your Majesty has asked an excellent question!

臣敢以實對
I will venture to present you with the facts.

臣之師有商丘子者
力无敵於天下
I had a teacher named Shang-ch’iu-tzǔ,
whose strength was unrivalled throughout the world;

but his own kin did not know about it,
because he never used his strength.

視人所不窺
Look at the things which others ignore.

so none but his own family hear of him.

it is because I have disobeyed my master’s teaching

然
則臣之名

I am famous,
not because I am proud of my strength,

中山公子牟者
魏國之賢公子也
Prince Mou of Chung-shan
was the cleverest of the sons of the lord of Wei.

好與賢人游
不恤國事
而悅趙人公孫龍
He liked to go around with clever people,
took no interest in state affairs,
and delighted in the sophist Kung-sun Lung of Chao.

樂正子輿之徒笑之
Men like Yüeh-cheng Tzǔ-yü laughed at him for this.

公子牟曰
Prince Mou asked Tzǔ-yü:

***

子何笑牟之悅公孫龍也
‘Why do you laugh at my taste for Kung-sun Lung?’

***

子輿曰
公孫龍之為人也
行无師
學无友
‘Kung-sun Lung is the kind of man
who goes ahead without a teacher,
and studies without having friends to advise him.

佞給
而不中
He is nimble with his tongue
but eccentric,
漫衍
而无家
a syncretist
who belongs to no one school,
好怪
而妄言
a lover of the extraordinary
who talks wildly,
欲惑人之心
屈人之口
trying to confuse men’s minds
and win verbal victories.

與韓檀等肄之
He studies with men like Han T’an.’

***

公子牟變容曰
Prince Mou looked grave and said:

***

何子狀公孫龍之過歟
‘Why do you give such an exaggerated account of him?

請聞其實
Let me hear you justify it.’

***

子輿曰
吾笑龍之詒孔穿
‘I laugh at the way Kung-sun Lung fooled K’ung Ch’uan.

言善射者
能令後鏃
中前括
He said that a good archer
can make the point of the arrow behind
hit the notch of the arrow in front.

發發相及
矢矢相屬
If he shoots so fast
that each catches up with the one in front,
all the arrows stick together.

前矢造準
而无絕落
When the first arrow reaches the target
none of them breaks off and drops
後矢之括
猶銜弦
and the notch of the last arrow
is still fitted to the bowstring,
視之
若一焉
so that to look at them
you would think there is only one arrow.

***

孔穿駭之
龍曰
‘K’ung Ch’uan was startled,
but Kung-sun Lung continued:

此未其妙者
“That is by no means the most remarkable case.

逢蒙之弟子
曰鴻超
怒其妻
而怖之
Hung Ch’ao,
a disciple of P’eng Meng,
was once angry with his wife
and wanted to frighten her.

引烏號之弓

fitted an arrow winged with the feathers of Chi,
and shot at her eye.

矢來注眸子
而眶不睫
The point of the arrow touched her pupil
without making the eyelid blink,
矢隧地
而塵不揚
and the arrow dropped to the ground
without raising the dust.”

是豈智者之言與
I ask you,
are these the words of a wise man?’

***

公子牟曰
智者之言
固非愚者之所曉
‘Naturally the words of a wise man
are beyond the comprehension of fools.

後鏃
中前括
鈞後於前
The point of the arrow behind
hits the notch of the arrow in front
because he makes each shot exactly equal to the one before.[^4-6]

矢注眸子
而眶不睫
盡矢之勢也
The arrow touches the pupil
without making the eyelid blink,
because the momentum of the arrow has given out.

子何疑焉
Why do you doubt it?’

***

樂正子輿曰
子龍之徒
焉得不飾其闕
‘You are Kung-sun Lung’s disciple,
of course it is your duty to gloss over his defects.

吾又言其尤者
I will tell you the most outrageous case of all.

龍誑
魏王曰
This is what Kung-sun Lung said
when he was making a fool of the King of Wei:

> 有意不心
“By conceiving something you fail to identify it;
有指不至
By pointing it out you fail to reach it;
有物不盡
By treating it as an object you fail to exhaust it.
有影不移
A shadow does not move.
髮引千鈞
A hair will draw a weight of a thousand _chün_.
白馬非馬
A white horse is not a horse.
孤犢未嘗有母
An orphan calf has never had a mother.”

其負類反倫
不可勝言也
There is no end
to his perversions of reason and sense.’

***

公子牟曰
子不諭至言
而以為尤也
‘You pretend that these sublime sayings are outrageous
simply because you can’t understand them;
尤其在子矣
it is your own attitude which is outrageous.

> 夫无意
則心同
Without concepts,
your mind is the same as it;
无指
則皆至
Without pointing,
you reach everything;
盡物者
常有
Whoever exhausts the object
exists for ever;[^4-7]
影不移者
說在改也
“A shadow does not move”:
the explanation is that it is replaced;[^4-8]
髮引千鈞
勢至等也
“A hair will draw a weight of a thousand _chün_”,
when the give and the pull are exactly equal;[^4-9]
白馬非馬
形名離也
“A white horse is not a horse”,
because the name diverges from the shape[^4-10]
孤犢未嘗有母
有母非孤犢也
“An orphan calf has never had a mother”,
because when it had it was not an orphan calf.’[^4-11]

***

樂正子輿曰
子以公孫龍之鳴皆條也
‘You think that all Kung-sun Lung’s mouthings make good sense.

設令發於餘竅
子亦將承之
Even if he blew them out of another hole,
you would go on believing him.’

***

公子牟默然
Prince Mou was silent for a while.

良久告退
曰
Then he took his leave,
saying:

***

請待餘日
更謁子論
‘Allow me to call on you another day
and discuss the matter again.’

[^4-6]: The archer does not have to aim at the arrow in front;
he merely needs to shoot each arrow with exactly the same stance.
Chang Chan notes:
‘In recent times there was a man who could throw _wu-mu_ (two-sided dice)
so that in a hundred throws
he never once failed to get the black side uppermost.
People thought he had the Way and told Wang Yen.
Wang Yen said:
“There is nothing strange about it.
It is simply that he makes each throw exactly like the one before.”’
(Kung-sun Lung’s argument
is simply that the archer can hit the preceding arrow.
The difficulty of shooting each arrow a little faster than the one before,
so that they all stick together,
does not enter into the question.)

[^4-7]: While the last four paradoxes are isolated logical puzzles,
the first three seem to belong together
and to be mystical propositions directed against logic.
Although very obscure,
their point is perhaps that,
since we are one with all things,
to analyse them,
point them out
and form ideas of them
does not bring us nearer to them,
but on the contrary separates us from them.
But if we cease to make distinctions,
we become the universe,
and therefore eternal.

[^4-8]: This is a quotation from the _Mohist Canons_,
where the explanation is given but is unfortunately corrupt.
The paradox also occurs in the last chapter of the _Chuang-tzǔ_
in the form
‘The shadow of a flying bird never moves’.
A comment on this by Ssu-ma Piao (died A.D. 306)
seems to be based on the _Mohist Canons_,
which he may have known in a better text:
‘The bird screens the light as a fish excludes the water.
When the fish moves it excludes the water
but the water does not move.
When the bird moves a shadow appears,
and wherever the shadow appears the light disappears.
But appearing and disappearing are not coming and going.’

[^4-9]: Cf. p. 105.

[^4-10]: A horse is identified as a horse by its shape,
irrespective of colour;
the name ‘white horse’ does not necessarily apply to it.
Kung-sun Lung’s _Essay on the White Horse_ is extant.
It criticises the proposition ‘White horses are horses’
on the assumption that it is identity,
not class membership, which is being affirmed.

[^4-11]: This exploits a purely verbal ambiguity;
the sentence _could_ mean
‘At no period of history have orphans had mothers’ (true)
instead of ‘At no period of their lives have orphans had mothers’ (false).
Cf. ‘No Pope has ever been a young man.’
