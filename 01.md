## 天瑞 Heaven’s Gifts

子列子居鄭圃
Lieh-tzǔ was living in Pu-t’ien,
the game preserve of the state of Cheng.

四十年人无識者
國君卿大夫眎之猶眾庶也
For forty years no one noticed him,
and the prince, the nobles and the high officials of the state
regarded him as one of the common people.

國不足
將嫁於衛
There was famine in Cheng,
and he decided to move to Wei.

弟子曰
His disciples said to him:

***

先生
往
无反期
‘Master,
you are going away,
and have set no time for your return.

弟子敢有所謁
Your disciples presume to make a request.

先生將何以教
What are you going to teach us before you go?

先生不聞壺丘子林之言乎
Did not your master Hu-tzǔ tell you anything?’

***

子列子笑曰
壺子何言哉
‘What did Hu-tzǔ ever say?’
Lieh-tzǔ answered smiling.

雖然
夫子嘗語伯昏瞀人
‘However,
I did once overhear him talking to Po-hun Wu-jen;
吾側聞之試以告女
I will try to tell you what he said.

其言曰
These were his words:

***

有生不生
有化不化
‘“There are the born and the Unborn,
the changing and the Unchanging.

不生者能生生
不化者能化化
The Unborn can give birth to the born,
the Unchanging can change the changing.

生者不能不生
化者不能不化
The born cannot escape birth,
the changing cannot escape change;
故常生常化
therefore birth and change are the norm.

常生常化者
无時不生
无時不化
Things for which birth and change are the norm
are at all times being born
and changing.

陰陽爾
四時爾
They simply follow the alternations of the Yin and Yang
and the four seasons.

> 不生者疑獨
The Unborn is by our side yet alone,
不化者往復
The Unchanging goes forth and returns.
往復
其際不可終
Going forth and returning,
its successions are endless;
疑獨
其道不可窮
By our side and alone,
its Way is boundless.

***

黃帝書曰
‘“The _Book of the Yellow Emperor_ says:

> 谷神不死
The Valley Spirit never dies:
是謂玄牝
It is called the dark doe.
玄牝之門
The gate of the dark doe
是謂天地之根
Is called the root of heaven and earth.
綿綿
若存
It goes on and on,
something which almost exists;
用之
不勤
Use it,
it never runs out.[^1-1]

***

故生物者不生
化物者不化
‘“Therefore that which gives birth to things is unborn,
that which changes things is unchanging.”’

***

自生自化
自形自色
_(Birth and change,_
_shape and colour,_
自智自力
自消自息
_wisdom and strength,_
_decrease and growth,_
_come about of themselves._

謂之
生化
形色
智力
消息者
非也
_It is wrong_
_to say that it brings about_
_birth and change,_
_shape and colour,_
_wisdom and strength,_
_decrease and growth.)_[^1-2]

[^1-1]: This passage is also found in the _Tao-te-ching_, ch. 6.

[^1-2]: If these obscure sentences are rightly translated,
they must be a critical note by another hand.

子列子曰
Lieh-tzǔ said:

***

昔者聖人因陰陽以統天地
‘Formerly the sages reduced heaven and earth
to a system by means of the Yin and Yang.

夫有形者生於无形
則天地安從生
But if all that has shape was born from the Shapeless,
from what were heaven and earth born?

故曰
I answer:

有太易
有太初
There was a Primal Simplicity,
there was a Primal Commencement,
有太始
有太素
there were Primal Beginnings,
there was a Primal Material.

太易者未見氣也
The Primal Simplicity preceded the appearance of the breath.

太初者氣之始也
The Primal Commencement was the beginning of the breath.

太始者形之始也
The Primal Beginnings were the breath beginning to assume shape.

太素者質之始也
The Primal Material was the breath
when it began to assume substance.

氣形質具
而未相離
Breath, shape and substance were complete,
but things were not yet separated from each other;
故曰渾淪
hence the name “Confusion”.

渾淪者言
萬物相渾淪
而未相離也
“Confusion” means
that the myriad things were confounded
and not yet separated from each other.

***

視之不見
聽之不聞
循之不得
‘Looking you do not see it,
listening you do not hear it,
groping you do not touch it;
故曰易也
hence the name “Simple”.

易无形埒
易變而為一
The Simple had no shape nor bounds,
the Simple altered and became one,
一變而為七
七變而為九
and from one altered to sevenfold,
from sevenfold to ninefold.

九者氣變之究也
Becoming ninefold is the last of the alterations of the breath.

乃復變而為一
Then it reverted to unity;
一者形變之始也
unity is the beginning of the alterations of shape.

清輕者上為天
濁重者下為地
沖和氣者為人
The pure and light rose to become heaven,
the muddy and heavy fell to become earth,
the breath which harmoniously blended both became man.

故天地含精
萬物化生
Hence the essences contained by heaven and earth,
and the birth and changing of the myriad things.’

***

子列子曰
Lieh-tzǔ said:

> 天地无全功
‘Heaven and earth cannot achieve everything;
聖人无全能
The sage is not capable of everything;
萬物无全用
None of the myriad things can be used for everything.

故
For this reason

> 天職生覆
It is the office of heaven to beget and to shelter,
地職形載
The office of earth to shape and to support,
聖職教化
The office of the sage to teach and reform,
物職所宜
The office of each thing to perform its function.

然則
天有所短
地有所長
聖有所否
物有所通
Consequently,
there are ways in which earth excels heaven,
and ways in which each thing is more intelligent than the sage.

何則
Why is this?

生覆者不能形載
形載者不能教化
Heaven which begets and shelters cannot shape and support,
earth which shapes and supports cannot teach and reform,
教化者不能違所宜
宜定者不出所位
the sage who teaches and reforms cannot make things
act counter to their functions,
things with set functions cannot leave their places.

故
天地之道非陰則陽
聖人之教非仁則義
萬物之宜非柔則剛
Hence
the Way of heaven and earth must be either Yin or Yang,
the teaching of the sage must be either kindness or justice,
and the myriad things, whatever their functions,
must be either hard or soft.

此皆隨所宜而不能出所位者也
All these observe their functions and cannot leave their places.

***

故有生者
有生生者
‘Hence there are the begotten
and the Begetter of the begotten,
有形者
有形形者
shapes
and the Shaper of shapes,
有聲者
有聲聲者
sounds
and the Sounder of sounds,
有色者
有色色者
colours
and the Colourer of colours,
有味者
有味味者
flavours
and the Flavourer of flavours.

生之所生者死矣
而生生者未嘗終
What begetting begets dies,
but the Begetter of the begotten never ends.

形之所形者實矣
而形形者未嘗有
What shaping shapes is real,
but the Shaper of shapes has never existed.

聲之所聲者聞矣
而聲聲者未嘗發
What sounding sounds is heard,
but the Sounder of sounds has never issued forth.

色之所色者彰矣
而色色者未嘗顯
What colouring colours is visible,
but the Colourer of colours never appears.

味之所味者嘗矣
而味味者未嘗呈
What flavouring flavours is tasted,
but the Flavourer of flavours is never disclosed.

皆无為之識也
All are the offices of That Which Does Nothing.

It is able to

> 能陰
能陽
能柔能剛
Make Yin,
make Yang,
soften or harden,
能短能長
能員能方
Shorten or lengthen,
round off or square,
能生能死
能暑能涼
Kill or beget,
warm or cool,
能浮能沈
能宮能商
Float or sink,
sound the *kung* note or the *shang*,
能出能沒
能玄能黃
Bring forth or submerge,
blacken or yellow,
能甘能苦
能羶能香
Make sweet or bitter,
make foul or fragrant.

无知也
无能也
It knows nothing
and is capable of nothing;
而无不知也
而无不能也
yet there is nothing which it does not know,
nothing of which it is incapable.’

子列子適衛食於道從者
見百歲髑髏
When Lieh-tzǔ was eating at the roadside on a journey to Wei,
he saw a skull a hundred years old.

攓蓬而指之
顧謂弟子百豐曰
He picked a stalk, pointed at it,
and said, turning to his disciple Pai-feng:

***

唯予與彼知而
未嘗生
未嘗死也
‘Only he and I know that
you were never born
and will never die.

此過養乎
此過歡乎
Is it he who is truly miserable,
is it we who are truly happy?

***

種有幾
‘Within the seeds of things there are germs.

若䵷為鶉得水
則為藚
When they find water
they develop in successive stages.

得水土之際
則為䵷蠙之衣
Reaching water on the edge of land,
they become a scum.

生於陵屯
則為陵舄
Breeding on the bank,
they become the plantain.

陵舄得鬱栖
則為烏足
When the plantain reaches dung,
it becomes the crowfoot.

烏足之根為蠐螬
其葉為胡蝶
The root of the crowfoot becomes woodlice,
the leaves become butterflies.

胡蝶胥也化而為蟲生於竈下
The butterfly suddenly changes into an insect
which breeds under the stove
其狀若脫
其名曰鴝掇
and looks as though it has shed its skin,
named the _ch’ü-to_.

鴝掇千日化而為鳥其名曰乾餘骨
After a thousand days the _ch’ü-to_ changes into a bird
named the _kan-yü-ku_.

乾餘骨之沫為斯彌
斯彌為食醯頤輅
The saliva of the _kan-yü-ku_ becomes the _ssǔ-mi_,
which becomes the vinegar animalcula _yi-lu_,
食醯頤輅生乎食醯黃軦
食醯黃軦生乎九猷
which begets the animalcula _huang-k’uang_,
which begets the _chiu-yu_,
九猷生乎瞀芮
瞀芮生乎腐蠸
which begets the gnat,
which begets the firefly.

羊肝化為地皋
_(Sheep’s liver changes into the goblin sheep underground._

馬血之轉為鄰也
人血之為野火也
_The blood of horses and men_
_becoming the will-o’-the-wisp;_

鷂之為鸇
鸇之為布穀
布穀之復為鷂也
_kites becoming sparrow-hawks,_

***

羊奚比乎不筍久竹生青寧
‘The _yang-hsi_,
combining with an old bamboo which has not put forth shoots,
begets the _ch’ing-ning_.

青寧生程
程生馬
馬生人
This begets the leopard,
which begets the horse,
which begets man.

人又入於機
Man in due course returns to the germs.

萬物皆出於機皆入於機
All the myriad things come out of germs and go back to germs.’[^1-3]

[^1-3]: Except for the italicised passage,
and an interpolation from the _Mohist Canons_ (3rd century B.C.)
after the first sentence
(‘Like frogs becoming quails’,
unintelligible in this context and omitted in the translation),
this whole section on metamorphoses
is taken from the _Chuang-tzǔ_ (3rd century B.C.).
It presents a continuous chain of development
from the original germs up to man,
with one break (between the firefly and the _yang-hsi_)
which is no doubt due to textual corruption.
Into this break the editor of the _Lieh-tzǔ_
has inserted a miscellaneous collection of metamorphoses
and strange births which obscures the sequence.

    The transformations of some animals and plants,
together with legends of abnormal births
(for example, horses giving birth to man),
inspired the original author with the idea,
immensely fruitful when it appeared independently
in the very different soil of Europe,
that even men might develop from the simplest germs
by a continuous process of generation and transformation.
It is not quite clear whether he was proposing evolution
as a historical process by which species originated,
or as a possibility realised
whenever there happens to be the right sequence
of normal and abnormal changes.
(In each sentence,
the present tense of the translation is arbitrary;
there is no indication of time.
The translation implies that there is animal dung (_yü-hsi_)
on land at the very beginning of the process;
but the meaning of _yü-hsi_ is not certain.)
The difference may not have seemed important to him,
for in a Taoist context the significance of the idea
is not that it explains the origin of man,
but that it shows that there is no absolute difference
between one thing and another,
and encourages us to see death,
not as the end of an individual,
but as part of a universal process of transformation.
In the _Chuang-tzǔ_ as in the _Lieh-tzǔ_ the passage follows,
and is apparently the continuation,
of Lieh-tzǔ’s speech about the skull.

    The identification of the plants and animals mentioned
is in many cases disputable.

黃帝書曰
The _Book of the Yellow Emperor_ says:

***

形動
不生形而生影
‘When a shape stirs,
it begets not a shape but a shadow.

聲動
不生聲而生響
When a sound stirs,
it begets not a sound but an echo.

无動
不生无而生有
When Nothing stirs,
it begets not nothing but something.’

***

形必終者也
That which has shape is that which must come to an end.

天地終乎
Will heaven and earth end?

與我偕終
They will end together with me.

終進乎
Will there ever be no more ending?

不知也
I do not know.

道終乎
Will the Way end?

本无始
At bottom it has had no beginning.

進乎
Will there ever be no more of it?

本不又
At bottom it does not exist.

***

有生則復於不生
有形則復於无形
Whatever is born reverts to being unborn,
whatever has shape reverts to being shapeless.

不生者非本不生者也
无形者非本无形者也
But unborn it is not the basically Unborn,
shapeless it is not the basically Shapeless.

生者理之必終者也
That which is born is that which in principle must come to an end.

終者不得不終
亦如生者之不得不生
Whatever ends cannot escape its end,
just as whatever is born cannot escape birth;
而欲恆其生
盡其終
惑於數也
and to wish to live forever,
and have no more of ending,
is to be deluded about our lot.

***

精神者天之又
骨骸者地之又
The spirit is the possession of heaven,
the bones are the possession of earth.

屬天清而散
屬地濁而聚
What belongs to heaven is pure and disperses,
what belongs to earth is dense and sticks together.

精神離形
各歸其真
When spirit parts from body,
each returns to its true state.

故謂之鬼
That is why ghosts are called _kuei_;
鬼者歸也
歸其真宅
_kuei_ means ‘one who has gone home’,
they have gone back to their true home.

黃帝曰
The Yellow Emperor said:

> 精神入其門
‘When my spirit goes through its door,
骨骸反其根
And my bones return to the root from which they grew,
我尚何存
What will remain of me?’

人自生至終
大化有四
From his birth to his end,
man passes through four great changes:
嬰孩也
少壯也
infancy,
youth,
老耄也
死亡也
old age,
death.

其在嬰孩氣專志一
In infancy his energies are concentrated
and his inclinations at one---
和之至也
the ultimate of harmony.

物不傷焉
德莫加焉
Other things do not harm him,
nothing can add to the virtue in him.

其在少壯
則血氣飄溢
欲慮充起
In youth,
the energies in his blood are in turmoil and overwhelm him,
desires and cares rise up and fill him.

物所攻焉
德故衰焉
Others attack him,
therefore the virtue wanes in him.

其在老耄
則欲慮柔焉
體將休焉
When he is old,
desires and cares weaken,
his body is about to rest.

物莫先焉
雖未及嬰孩之全
Nothing contends to get ahead of him,
and although he has not reached the perfection of infancy,
方於少壯間矣
compared with his youth
there is a great difference for the better.

其在死亡也
則之於息焉
反其極矣
When he dies,
he goes to his rest,
rises again to his zenith.

孔子遊於太山
見榮啟期行乎郕之野
When Confucius was roaming on Mount T’ai,
he saw Jung Ch’i-ch’i walking in the moors of Ch’eng,
鹿裘帶索
鼓琴而歌
in a rough fur coat with a rope round his waist,
singing as he strummed a lute.

孔子問曰
先生所以樂何也
‘Master, what is the reason for your joy?’
asked Confucius.

***

對曰吾樂甚多
‘I have very many joys.

天生萬物唯人為貴
而吾既得為人矣
Of the myriad things which heaven begot mankind is the most noble,
and I have the luck to be human;
是一樂也
this is my first joy.

男女之別
男尊女卑
故以男為貴
Of the two sexes,
men are ranked higher than women,
therefore it is noble to be a man.

吾既得為男矣
I have the luck to be a man;
是二樂也
this is my second joy.

人生有不見日月
不免襁褓者
People are born who do not live a day or a month,
who never get out of their swaddling clothes.

吾既已行年九十矣
But I have already lived to ninety;
是三樂也
this is my third joy.

貧者士之常也
死者人之終也
For all men poverty is the norm
and death is the end.

處常
得終
當何憂哉
Abiding by the norm,
awaiting my end,
what is there to be concerned about?’

***

孔子曰善乎
‘Good!’ said Confucius.

能自寬者也
‘He is a man who knows how to console himself.’

---

林類年且百歲
底春被裘
When Lin Lei was nearly a hundred,
he put on his fur coat in the middle of spring,
拾遺穗於故畦
並歌並進
and went to pick up the grains dropped by the reapers,
singing as he made his way through the fields.

孔子
適衛
Confucius,
who was on a journey to Wei,
望之於野
顧謂弟子曰
saw him in the distance from the moors,
and turned to his disciples.

***

彼叟可與言者
‘That old man should be worth talking to.

試往訊之
Someone should go and find out what he has to say.’

***

子貢請行
Tzǔ-kung asked to be the one to go.

逆之壠端
面之而歎曰
He met Lin Lei at the end of the embankment,
looked him in the face and sighed.

***

先生曾不悔乎
‘Don’t you even feel any regret?

而行歌拾穗
Yet you pick up the grains singing as you go.’

***

林類
行不留
歌不輟
Lin Lei
neither halted his steps
nor paused in his song.

子貢叩之不已
乃仰而應曰
Tzǔ-kung went on pressing him,
until he looked up and answered:

***

吾何悔邪
‘What have I to regret?’

子貢曰先生

> 少
不勤行
---‘A child,
you never learned how to behave;
長
不競時
A man,
you never strove to make your mark.
老无妻子
死期將至
No wife nor son in your old age,
And the time of your death is near.

亦有何樂
而拾穗行歌乎
Master,
what happiness have you had,
that you should sing as you walk picking up the grains?’

***

林類笑曰
吾之所以為樂人皆有之
‘The reasons for my happiness all men share,’
said Lin Lei smiling.

而反以為憂
‘But instead they worry over them.

少不勤行
長不競時
故能壽若此
It is because
I took no pains learning to behave when I was young,
and never strove to make my mark when I grew up,
that I have been able to live so long.

老无妻子
死期將至
故能樂若此
It is because
I have no wife and sons in my old age,
and the time of my death is near,
that I can be so happy.’

***

子貢曰
壽者人之情
死者人之惡
‘It is human to want long life
and hate death.

子以死為樂何也
Why should you be happy to die?’

***

林類曰
死之與生一往一反
‘Death is a return to where we set out from
when we were born.

故死於是者
安知不生於彼
So how do I know that when I die here
I shall not be born somewhere else?

故吾知其不相若矣
How do I know that life and death are not as good as each other?

吾又安知營營而求生之非惑乎
How do I know that it is not a delusion to crave anxiously for life?

亦又安知吾今之死不愈昔之生乎
How do I know that present death
would not be better than my past life?’

***

子貢聞之不喻其意
Tzǔ-kung listened but did not understand his meaning.

還以告夫子
He returned and told Confucius.

***

夫子曰
吾知其可與言
‘I knew he would be worth talking to,’
said Confucius.

果然
‘And so he is.

然彼得之
而不盡者也
But he is a man who has found it,
yet not found all of it.’[^1-4]

[^1-4]: Lin Lei has not learned the unreality
of the difference between life and death,
joy and sorrow;
he has to reconcile himself to death
by persuading himself that he may be happier dead.
The commentator Chang Chan finds the same qualification
in the praise of Jung Ch’i-ch’i as
‘a man who knows how to console himself’ in the previous story.
‘He is unable to forget joy and misery altogether;
Confucius merely praises his ability to console himself with reasons.’

子貢倦於學
告仲尼曰
Tzǔ-kung grew weary of study,
and told Confucius:
願有所息
‘I want to find rest.’

***

仲尼曰
生无所息
‘There is no rest for the living.’

***

子貢曰
然則賜息无所乎
‘Then shall I never find it?’

***

仲尼曰
有焉耳
‘You shall.

望其壙
睪如也
宰如也
墳如也

則知所息矣
Look forward to the lofty and domed mound of your tomb,
and know where you shall find rest.’

子貢曰
大哉死乎
‘Great is death!

君子息焉
小人伏焉
The gentleman finds rest in it,
the mean man submits to it!’

***

仲尼曰
賜汝知之矣
‘Tzǔ-kung, you have understood.

人胥
知生之樂未知生之苦
知老之憊未知老之佚
知死之惡未知死之息也
All men
understand the joy of being alive but not its misery,
the weariness of growing old but not its ease,
the ugliness of death but not its repose.’

---

晏子曰
Yen-tzǔ said:

***

善哉古之有死也
‘How well the men of old understood death!

仁者息焉
不仁者伏焉
The good find rest in it,
the wicked submit to it.’

***

死也者德之徼也
Dying is the virtue in us going to its destination.

古者謂死人為歸人
The men of old called a dead man ‘a man who has gone back’.

夫言死人為歸人
則生人為行人矣
Saying that the dead have gone back
they implied that the living are travellers.

行而不知歸失家者也
The traveller who forgets to go back
is a man who mistakes his home.

一人失家
一世非之
If one man mistakes his home,
the whole world disapproves;
天下失家
莫知非焉
but when everyone under the sky mistakes his home,
no one is wise enough to disapprove.

有人
去鄉土
離六親
廢家業
遊於四方而不歸者
Suppose that a man
leaves his native soil,
parts from all his kin,
and abandons his family responsibilities
to wander over the four quarters without going back---
何人哉
what sort of man is he?

世必謂之為狂蕩之人矣
The world is sure to call him a crazy and reckless man.

又有人
鍾賢世
矜巧能
脩名譽
誇張於世而不知己者
Suppose again there is a man
who values his body and his life,
presumes on his skill and ability,
cultivates fame and reputation,
and cannot stop boasting to the world---
亦何人哉
what sort of man is he?

世必以為智謀之士
The world is sure to reckon him a clever and practical man.

此二者胥失者也
而世與一不與一
Both of these are men who have gone wrong,
yet the world sides with one and against the other.

唯聖人
知所與
知所去
Only the sage
knows whom to side with,
whom to reject.

或謂子列子曰
Someone asked Lieh-tzǔ:

子奚貴虛
‘Why do you value emptiness?’

‘In emptiness there is no valuing.’

Lieh-tzǔ said:

‘“Value” is not the name for it.

Best be still,
best be empty.

In stillness and emptiness,
we find where to abide;
取也與也

Taking and giving,
we lose the place.

而後有舞仁義者
弗能復也
The man who,
when his actions go wrong,
begins to play about with moral distinctions
in order to put them right,
cannot find the way back.’

粥熊曰
Yü Hsiung said:

> 運轉亡已
‘Turning without end
天地密移
Heaven and earth shift secretly.
疇覺之哉
Who is aware of it?’

***

故物
損於彼者盈於此
成於此者虧於彼
So the thing which is shrinking there is swelling here,
the thing which is maturing here is decaying there.

損盈
成虧
隨世隨死
Shrinking and swelling,
maturing and decaying,
it is being born at the same time that it is dying.

往來相接閒不可省
The interval between the coming and the going is imperceptible;
疇覺之哉
who is aware of it?

凡
一氣不頓進
一形不頓虧
Whatever a thing may be,
its energy is not suddenly spent,
its form does not suddenly decay;
亦不覺其成
亦不覺其虧
we are aware neither of when it reaches maturity
nor of when it begins to decay.

亦如人自世至老
It is the same with a man’s progress from birth to old age;
貌色智態亡日不異
皮膚爪髮隨世隨落
his looks, knowledge and bearing differ from one day to the next,
his skin and nails and hair are growing
at the same time as they are falling away.

非嬰孩時有停而不易也
They do not stop as they were in childhood without changing.

閒不可覺
But we cannot be aware of the intervals;
俟至後知
we must wait for their fruition before we know.

杞國有人
憂天地崩墜
身亡所寄
廢寢食者
There was a man of Ch’i country
who was so worried that heaven and earth might fall down,
and his body would have nowhere to lodge,
that he forgot to eat and sleep.

又有憂彼之所憂者
因往曉之曰
There was another man who was worried
that he should be so worried about it,
and therefore went to enlighten him.

***

天積氣耳
‘Heaven is nothing but the accumulated air;
亡處亡氣
there is no place where there is not air.

若屈伸
呼吸
終日在天中行止
You walk and stand all day inside heaven,
stretching and bending,
breathing in and breathing out;
奈何憂崩墜乎
why should you worry about it falling down?’

***

其人曰
天果積氣
日月星宿不當墜邪
‘If heaven really is accumulated air,
shouldn’t the sun and moon and stars fall down?’

***

曉之者曰
日月星宿亦積氣中之有光耀者
‘The sun and moon and stars
are air which shines inside the accumulated air.

只使墜
亦不能有所中傷
Even if they did fall down,
they couldn’t hit or harm anyone.’

***

其人曰
奈地壞何
‘What about the earth giving way?’

***

曉者曰
地積塊耳
充塞四虛
‘The earth is nothing but accumulated soil,
filling the void in all four directions;
亡處亡塊
there is no place where there is not soil.

若躇步跐蹈
終日在地上行止
You walk and stand all day on the earth,
stamping about with abrupt spurts and halts;
奈何憂其壞
why should you worry about it giving way?’

***

其人舍然大喜
The man was satisfied and greatly cheered;
曉之者亦舍然大喜
and so was the man who enlightened him.

***

長廬子聞
而笑之曰
When Ch’ang-lu-tzǔ heard of it,
he said smiling:

***

虹蜺也
雲霧也
‘The rainbow,
clouds and mist,
風雨也
四時也
wind and rain,
the four seasons;
此積氣之成乎天者也
these are formations in the accumulated air of heaven.

山岳也
河海也
Mountains and hills,
rivers and seas,
金石也
火木也
metal and stone,
fire and wood;
此積形之成乎地者也
these are formations in the accumulated matter of earth.

知積氣也
知積塊也
奚謂不壞
Knowing that they are accumulations of air and soil,
how can we say that they will not perish?

夫天地
空中之一細物
有中之最巨者
Heaven and earth
are one tiny thing within the void,
the largest among things that exist.

難終難窮
此固然矣
It is no doubt true that it will be long
before they reach their term and come to an end,
難測難識
此固然矣
and that it is no easy matter
to estimate and predict when this will happen.

憂其壞者誠為大遠
To worry about them perishing is indeed wide of the mark;
言其不壞者亦為未是
but to say they will never perish is also open to objection.

天地不得不壞
則會歸於壞
Since heaven and earth are bound to perish,
a time will come when they will perish.

遇其壞時
奚為不憂哉
If we happen to be here when they do,
why shouldn’t we worry?’

***

子列子聞
而笑曰
When Lieh-tzǔ heard of it,
he too smiled and said:

***

言天地壞者亦謬
言天地不壞者亦謬
‘It is nonsense to say either that heaven and earth will perish
or that they will not.

壞與不壞吾所不能知也
Whether they perish or not we can never know.

雖然
彼一也
此一也
However,
from that side there is one point of view,
from this side there is another.

故
生不知死
死不知生
Hence
the living do not know what it is like to be dead,
the dead do not know what it is like to be alive.

來不知去
去不知來
Coming, we do not know those who went before,
going we shall not know those who come after.

壞與不壞吾何容心哉
Why should we care whether they perish or not?’[^1-5]

[^1-5]: This story,
beginning with the humorous anecdote of the neurotic
afraid that heaven and earth will fall down,
gradually becomes serious and is given a double twist:
(1) Everything is transient, even heaven and earth.
(2) We can be reconciled even to the transience of heaven and earth.
It is unnecessary to be appalled by the possibility
of a universe in which heaven and earth have ceased to exist,
because we cannot conceive such a universe,
and anything which existed in it could not conceive ours.
The neurotic imagined himself surviving the destruction of heaven and earth
with ‘nowhere for his body to lodge’;
but as Chang Chan notes,
‘As long as they do not perish,
they are intact together with man;
when they do perish,
they will be destroyed together with man.’

舜問乎烝曰
Shun asked a minister:

***

道可得而有乎
‘Can one succeed in possessing the Way?’

***

曰汝身非汝有也
‘Your own body is not your possession.

汝何得有夫道
How can you possess the Way?’

***

舜曰
吾身非吾有
孰有之哉
‘If my own body is not mine,
whose is it?’

***

曰是天地之委形也
‘It is the shape lent to you by heaven and earth.

生非汝有
Your life is not your possession;
是天地之委和也
it is harmony between your forces,
granted for a time by heaven and earth.

性命非汝有
Your nature and destiny are not your possessions;
是天地之委順也
they are the course laid down for you by heaven and earth.

孫子非汝有
Your children and grandchildren are not your possessions;
是天地之委蛻也
heaven and earth lend them to you to cast off from your body
as an insect sheds its skin.

故行不知所往
處不知所持
食不知所以
Therefore you travel without knowing where you go,
stay without knowing what you cling to,
are fed without knowing how.

天地強陽氣也
You are the breath of heaven and earth which goes to and fro;
又胡可得而有邪
how can you ever possess it?’

齊之國氏大富
Mr Kuo of Ch’i was very rich.

宋之向氏大貧
自宋之齊請其術
Mr Hsiang of Sung, who was very poor,
travelled from Sung to Ch’i to inquire about his methods.

***

國氏告之曰
吾善為盜
‘I am good at stealing,’
Mr Kuo told him.

始吾為盜也
一年而給
二年而足
三年大壤
‘After I first became a thief,
within a year I could keep myself,
within two I was comfortable,
within three I was flourishing,
自此以往施及州閭
and ever since then I have been the benefactor
of the whole neighbourhood.’

***

向氏大喜
Hsiang was delighted;
喻其為盜之言
而不喻其為盜之道
he understood from what Kuo said that he was a thief,
but misunderstood his Way of being a thief.

遂踰垣鑿室
手目所及亡不探也
So he climbed over walls and broke into houses,
and grabbed anything in reach of his eye and hand.

未及時
以贓獲罪
沒其先居之財
Before long,
he was found guilty of possessing stolen goods,
and lost his whole inheritance.

向氏以國氏之謬己也
往而怨之
Thinking that Kuo had deceived him,
he went to him to complain.

***

國氏曰
若為盜若何
‘In what way have you been stealing?’
Kuo asked him.

***

向氏言其狀
Hsiang described what had happened.

***

國氏曰
嘻
‘Alas!’
Kuo said.

若失為盜之道至此乎
‘Have you erred so far from the true Way of stealing?

今將告若矣
Let me explain.

吾聞
I have heard it said:
天有時
地有利
“Heaven has its seasons,
earth has its benefits.”

吾盜天地之時利
雲雨之滂潤
山澤之產育
I rob heaven and earth of their seasonal benefits,
the clouds and rain of their irrigating floods,
the mountains and marshes of their products,
以生吾禾
殖吾稼
in order to grow my crops,
plant my seed,
築吾垣
建吾舍
raise my walls,
build my house.

陸盜禽獸
水盜魚鱉
I steal birds and animals from the land,
fish and turtles from the water.

亡非盜也
All this is stealing;
夫禾稼
土木
for crops and seed,
clay and wood,
禽獸
魚鱉
birds and animals,
fish and turtles,
皆天之所生
豈吾之所有
are all begotten by heaven,
and how can they become my possessions?

然吾盜天而亡殃
Yet I suffer no retribution for robbing heaven.

夫金玉珍寶
穀帛財貨
On the other hand precious things such as gold and jade,
and commodities such as grain and silk,
人之所聚
豈天之所與
are collected by men,
and how can we claim that it is heaven which provides them?

若盜之
而獲罪孰怨哉
When you steal them,
why should you resent being found guilty?’

***

向氏大惑
以為國氏之重罔己也
Hsiang was highly perplexed,
and thought that Kuo was trapping him again.

過東郭先生問焉
東郭先生曰
Happening to meet Master Tung-kuo,
he questioned him and got this answer:

***

若一身庸非盜乎
‘Is not your very body stolen?

盜陰陽之和
以成若生載若形
況外物而非盜哉
When you must steal the Yin and Yang energies in harmonious proportions
even to achieve your life and sustain your body,
how can you take the things outside you without stealing them?

誠然天地萬物不相離也
In reality the myriad things of heaven and earth
are not separate from each other;
仞而有之皆惑也
and to claim anything as one’s own is always wrong-headed.

國氏之盜公道也
故亡殃
Kuo’s way of stealing is common to all,
and so he escapes retribution;
若之盜私心也
故得罪
your motive for stealing is private,
and so you were found guilty.

有公私者亦盜也
亡公私者亦盜也
Whether or not you distinguish between common and private,
you are still stealing.

公公私私
天地之德
It is the power of heaven and earth
which makes the common common and the private private.

知天地之德者
孰為盜邪
孰為不盜邪
For the man who understands the power of heaven and earth,
what is stealing and what is not stealing?’
