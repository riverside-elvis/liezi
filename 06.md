## 力命 Endeavour and Destiny

力謂命曰
Endeavour said to Destiny:

***

若之功奚若我哉
‘How can your effect be as great as mine?’

***

命曰
汝奚功於物
而欲比朕
‘What effect on things do you have,
that you should wish to compare yourself with me?’

***

力曰
壽夭
窮達
‘Whether a man lives long or dies young,
succeeds or fails,
貴賤
貧富
has high rank or low,
is poor or rich,
我力之所能也
all this is within the reach of my endeavour.’

***

命曰
彭祖之智不出
堯舜之上
而壽八百
‘P’eng Tsu was no wiser
than Yao and Shun,
yet he lived eight hundred years;
顏淵之才不出
眾人之下
而壽十八
Yen Yuan was no less talented
than ordinary men,
yet he died at eighteen.

仲尼之德不出
諸侯之下
而困於陳蔡
Confucius was no less virtuous
than the feudal lords,
but they distressed him in Ch’en and Ts’ai;
殷紂之行不出
三仁之上
而居君位
the Yin Emperor Chou did not behave better
than the three good ministers he executed,
but he sat on the throne.

季札无爵於吳
田恆專有齊國
Chi Cha had no rank in Wu,
yet T’ien Heng became sole master of the state of Ch’i.

夷齊餓於首陽
季氏富於展禽
Po Yi and Shu Ch’i starved to death on Mount Shou-yang,
but the Chi family grew richer than Chan Ch’in.[^6-1]

若是汝力之所能
If all this is within the reach of your endeavour,
柰何壽彼
而夭此
why did you give long life to one
and early death to the other,
窮聖
而達逆
why did you permit the sage to fail
and villains to succeed,
賤賢
而貴愚
demean an able man
and exalt a fool,
貧善
而富惡邪
impoverish good men
and enrich a bad one?’

***

力曰
若如若言
我固无功於物
‘If it is as you say,
certainly I have no effect on things.

而物若此邪
此則若之所制邪
But is it you who directs
that things should be so?’

***

命曰
既謂之命
柰何有制之者邪
‘When we say that a thing is destined,
how can there be anyone who directs it?

朕直而推之
曲而任之
I push it when it is going straight,
let it take charge when it is going crooked.

自壽自夭
自窮自達
Long life and short,
failure and success,
自貴自賤
自富自貧
high rank and low,
wealth and poverty,
come about of themselves.

朕豈能識之哉
What can I know about it?

朕豈能識之哉
What can I know about it?’

[^6-1]: P’eng Tsu is remembered only as the Chinese Methuselah.
For the sages Yao and Shun,
and the tyrant Chou,
see the chronological table.

    Yen Yuan (Yen Hui)
was the favourite disciple of Confucius (cf. pp. 75ff.).

    Chi Cha, youngest son of Viscount Shou-meng (585-561 B.C.) of Wu,
was offered the throne of Wu on account of his virtue,
but repeatedly declined it in deference to his three elder brothers,
who occupied it in turn.

    The minister Tien Heng killed Duke Chien of Ch’i in 481 B.C.
and set up a puppet in his place.
The T’ien line became Dukes of Ch’i in name as well as in fact from 375 B.C.

    Po Yi and Shu Chi were brothers who both refused the fief of Ku-chu,
Shu Ch’i because he was the younger,
Po Yi because their father had named Shu Ch’i as his heir.
On the fall of the Yin (?1122 B.C.)
they refused to recognise the authority of the new dynasty,
fled to Mount Shou-yang,
and starved to death.

    Chan Ch’in (Liu-hsia Hui),
Leader of the Knights in Lu,
was three times dismissed because of his uncompromising honesty.
The unscrupulous Chi family, on the other hand,
won control of the state
and forced Duke Chao (541-510 B.C.) of Lu into exile.

北宮子
謂西門子曰
Pei-kung-tzǔ
said to Hsi-men-tzǔ:

***

朕與子並世也
而人子達
‘I belong to the same generation as you,
but it is you whom others help to success;
並族也
而人子敬
to the same clan,
but it is you whom they respect;

並貌也
而人子愛
we look the same,
but it is you whom they love;
並言也
而人子庸
we talk the same,
but it is you whom they employ;
並行也
而人子誠
we act the same,
but it is you whom they trust.

並仕也
而人子貴
If we take office together,
it is you whom they promote;
並農也
而人子富
if we farm together,
you whom they enrich;
並商也
而人子利
if we trade together,
you whom they profit.

朕衣則裋褐
食則粢糲
I wear coarse wool
and eat coarse millet,
居則蓬室
出則徒行
live in a thatched hut
and go out on foot.

子衣則文錦
食則粱肉
You wear brocades
and eat fine millet and meat,
居則連欐
出則結駟
live under linked rafters
and go out in a car with four horses.

在家
熙然有棄朕之心
At home
you complacently ignore me,
在朝
諤然有敖朕之色
in court
you treat me with undisguised arrogance.

請謁不相及
遨游不同行
固有年矣
Certainly it has been many years
since we called on each other
or made an excursion together.

子自以德過朕邪
Is it because you think your worth greater than mine?’

***

西門子曰
予无以知其實
‘I have no way of knowing the truth of the matter.

汝造事而窮
予造事而達
But whatever we undertake,
you fail
and I succeed.

此
厚薄之驗
歟
Does this
perhaps
show that there is more in me than in you?

而皆謂與予並
汝之顏厚矣
Yet you have the face to say that in every way
you are the same as me.’

***

北宮子无以應
自失而歸
Pei-kung-tzǔ could find no answer,
and went home lost in thought.

中途遇東郭先生
先生曰
On the road he met Master Tung-kuo,
who asked him:

***

汝奚往而反
偊偊而步
有深愧之色邪
‘Where have you come from,
walking by yourself
with such deep shame on your face?’

***

北宮子言其狀
Pei-kung-tzǔ described what had happened.

***

東郭先生曰
吾將舍汝之愧
‘I am going to clear you of shame,’
Master Tung-kuo said.

與汝更之西門氏
而問之
‘Let us go back to Hsi-men-tzǔ
and ask him some questions?’

***

曰
汝奚辱北宮子之深乎
固且言之
He asked Hsi-men-tzǔ
to explain
why he had humiliated Pei-kung-tzǔ so deeply,
and Hsi-men-tzǔ repeated what he had said to Pei-kung-tzǔ.

{西門子曰
北宮子言世族

年貌言行與予並
而賤貴貧富與予異

予語之曰
予无以知其實

汝造事而窮
予造事而達
此將厚薄之驗歟

而皆謂與予並
汝之顏厚矣}

***

東郭先生曰
汝之言
厚薄
‘When you say
that one man has more in him than another,’
Master Tung-kuo answered,
不過言
才德之差
‘you mean only
that they are not equally gifted.

吾之言厚薄
異於是矣
What I mean
is something different from this.

夫北宮子
厚於德
薄於命
Pei-kung-tzǔ
has more worth
than luck,
汝
厚於命
薄於德
you
have more luck
than worth.

汝之達
非智得也
Your success
is not due to wisdom,
北宮子之窮
非愚失也
nor is his failure
due to foolishness.

皆天也
非人也
Both are from heaven
and not from man,
而汝以命厚自矜
北宮子以德厚自愧
yet you are presumptuous because you have more luck,
while he is ashamed although he has more worth.

皆不識
夫固然之理矣
Neither of you perceives
the principle that things must be as they are.’

***

西門子曰
先生止矣
予不敢復言
‘Enough, Master!’
said Hsi-men-tzǔ,
‘I shall never dare to say it again.’

***

北宮子既歸
衣其裋褐
有狐貉之溫
When Pei-kung-tzǔ got home,
the coarse wool that he wore
was as warm as the fur of fox or badger,
進其茙菽
有稻粱之味
the broad beans served to him
were as tasty as rice or millet,
庇其蓬室
若廣廈之蔭
the shelter of his thatched hut
was as shady as a wide hall,
乘其篳輅
若文軒之飾
the wicker-work cart on which he rode
was as handsome as an ornamented carriage.

終身
逌然
He was content
for the rest of his life,
不知
榮辱之
and no longer knew
which was honoured and which despised,
在彼也
在我也
the other man
or himself.

***

東郭先生聞之曰
北宮子之寐久矣
‘Pei-kung-tzǔ has been fast asleep for a long time,’
said Master Tung-kuo.

一言
而能寤
易悟也哉
‘But a man to whom
you need to speak only once
is easily awakened.’

管夷吾
鮑叔牙
Kuan Chung
and Pao Shu-ya
二人相友甚戚
同處於齊
lived together in Ch’i
as the closest of friends.

管夷吾
事公子糾
Kuan Chung
served Chiu,
鮑叔牙
事公子小白
Pao Shu-ya
served Hsiao-po,
two of the sons of the Duke of Ch’i.

齊公族多寵
嫡
庶
並行
There was much favouritism in the Duke’s clan,
and the sons of concubines
were treated the same
as the sons of his wife.

國人懼亂
管仲與召忽
奉公子糾
奔魯
The people were afraid that disorder would follow,
and the Duke’s son Chiu
fled to Lu
attended by Kuan Chung and a certain Shao Hu,
鮑叔
奉公子小白
奔莒
while Hsiao-po
fled to Chü
attended by Pao Shu-ya.

***

既
而公孫无知作亂
齊无君
二公子爭入
Afterwards,
when Kung-sun Wu-chih rebelled
and there was no ruler in Ch’i,
the two sons of the Duke contended for the throne.

管夷吾
與小白
戰於莒
Kuan Chung
fought a battle
with Hsiao-po in Chü,
道射中
小白帶鉤
and shot an arrow on the road
which hit the buckle of Hsiao-po’s belt.

小白既立
脅魯殺子糾
When Hsiao-po won the throne and became Duke Huan,
he forced the people of Lu to kill his brother Chiu.

召忽死之
管夷吾被囚
Shao Hu committed suicide
rather than survive his master,
and Kuan Chung was imprisoned.

***

鮑叔牙
謂桓公曰
Pao Shu-ya
said to Duke Huan:

***

管夷吾能
‘Kuan Chung is capable.

可以治國
He is fit to rule the state.’

***

桓公曰
我讎也
願殺之
‘He is my enemy,
I wish to kill him.’

***

鮑叔牙曰
吾聞
賢君
无私怨
‘I have heard
that a worthy ruler
has no personal grudges.

且
人能為其主
亦必能為人君
Besides,
a man who is capable of loyalty to his master
will certainly be as capable of loyalty to another prince.

如欲
霸
王
If you wish
to win hegemony among the rulers of the states,
or the Imperial throne itself,
非夷吾
其弗可
you cannot do it
without Kuan Chung.

君必舍之
You must have him released.’

***

遂召管仲
魯歸之齊
So the Duke called for Kuan Chung,
and the people of Lu sent him back to Ch’i.

鮑叔牙
郊迎
釋其囚
Pao Shu-ya
welcomed him outside the city
and undid his chains.

桓公
禮之
而位於高國之上
鮑叔牙以身下之
Duke Huan
received him with all ceremony
and gave him a position above the Kao and Kuo families,
and Pao Shu-ya was content to be under him.

任以國政
號曰仲父
Kuan Chung
assumed responsibility for the government of the state
and was given the name Chung-fu;
桓公
遂霸
and in due course Duke Huan
attained hegemony among the rulers of the states.

***

管仲嘗歎曰
Once Kuan Chung sighed and said:

***

吾少
窮困時
嘗與鮑叔賈
‘In my youth,
when I was in difficulties,
I used to trade in partnership with Pao Shu-ya.

分財多自與
鮑叔不以我為貪
知
我貧也
I took the larger share of the profits for myself,
but he did not think me greedy,
because he knew
that I was poor.

吾嘗為鮑叔謀事
而大窮困
I used to plan enterprises for Pao Shu-ya,
and got into still worse difficulties;
鮑叔不以我為愚
知
時有利不利也
but he did not think me a fool,
because he knew
that the times are not always favourable.

吾嘗三仕
三見逐於君
I was in office three times,
and three times was evicted by the Duke;
鮑叔不以我為不肖
知
我不遭時也
but he did not think me worthless,
because he knew
that my opportunity had not come.

吾嘗三戰
三北
I fought three battles
and three times showed my back;
鮑叔不以我為怯
知
我有老母也
but he did not think me a coward,
because he knew
that I had an old mother to support.

公子糾敗
召忽死之
吾幽囚受辱
When Chiu perished
and Shao Hu committed suicide rather than survive him,
I preferred the disgrace of imprisonment;
鮑叔不以我為无恥
知
我不羞小節
而恥功名
不顯於天下也
but he did not think me shameless,
because he knew
that I was not embarrassed by small dishonours,
but ashamed only that my name
was not renowned throughout the world.

生我者父母
知我者鮑叔也
It was my father and mother who bore me,
but it is Pao Shu-ya who understands me.’

***

此世稱
管鮑
善交者
Consequently the world praised
Kuan Chung and Pao Shu-ya
for their skill in choosing allies,
小白
善用能者
and Duke Huan
for his skill in employing capable men.

然
實无善交
實无用能也
But really
none of them was skilful
in either of these ways.

實无善交
實无用能者
This does not mean that anyone else
has been more skilful in choosing allies
or employing capable men.

召忽
非能死
不得不死
It is not that Shao Hu
was able to give his life,
he could not do otherwise;
鮑叔
非能舉賢
不得不舉
it is not that Pao Shu-ya
was able to appoint a man of worth,
he could not do otherwise;
小白
非能用讎
不得不用
it is not that Duke Huan
was able to employ his enemy,
he could not do otherwise.

***

及管夷吾有病
小白問之曰
When Kuan Chung fell ill,
Duke Huan asked him:

***

仲父之病病矣
可不諱云
‘Your illness is critical,
it is time to say so directly.

至於大病
則寡人惡乎屬國而可
If it proves fatal,
to whom should I hand over the state?’

***

夷吾曰
公誰欲歟
‘Whom would you prefer?’

***

小白曰
鮑叔牙可
‘Pao Shu-ya might do.’

***

曰
不可
‘No.

其為人也
潔廉善士也
His character
is inflexibly moral to the point of bigotry.

其於不己若者
不比之人
Anyone who is not as upright as himself
he treats as less than human.

一聞
人之過
If he once hears
that a man has made a mistake
終身
不忘
he does not forget it
for the rest of his life.

使之理國
上且鉤乎君
下且逆乎民
If you let him govern the state,
he will offend both yourself above him
and the people below him;
其得罪於君也
將弗久矣
it will not be long
before you find it necessary to punish him.’

***

小白曰
然則孰可
‘In that case whom would you suggest?’

***

對曰
勿已
則隰朋可
‘Unless you have someone better in mind
Hsi P’eng will do.

其為人也
上忘
而下不叛
He is the sort of man
who can forget his high position
without those under him becoming insubordinate.

愧其
不若黃帝
He is ashamed
that he is not as good as the Yellow Emperor,
而哀
不己若者
and is sorry for
those who are not as good as himself.

> 以德分人
謂之聖人
The highest sage
shares his moral possessions with others.
以財分人
謂之賢人
The next in wisdom
shares his material possessions with others.
以賢
臨人
未有得人者也
The man who because of his own wisdom
looks down on others
has never won men’s hearts.
以賢
下人者
未有不得人者也
The man who in spite of his own wisdom
is humble to others
has never failed to win men’s hearts.

其於國有
不聞也
Hsi P’eng does not want to be told
everything which is wrong with the state,
其於家有
不見也
does not want to notice
everything which is wrong with his own family.

勿已
則隰朋可
Unless you have someone better in mind,
Hsi P’eng will do.’

***

然則
管夷吾
非薄鮑叔也
不得不薄
非厚隰朋也
不得不厚
Thus
it was not that
Kuan Chung neglected Pao Shu-ya
and favoured Hsi P’eng;
he could not have treated them otherwise.

厚之於始
或薄之於終
Some whom we favour at first
we end by neglecting,
薄之於終
或厚之於始
some whom we end by neglecting
we favour at first.

厚薄之去來
弗由我也
The alternations of favour and neglect
do not depend on ourselves.

鄧析
操兩可之說
設无窮之辭
Teng Hsi
maintained ambiguous assertions
and never ran out of arguments to support them.

當子產
執政
作竹刑
When Tzǔ-ch’an
was chief minister in Cheng,
Teng Hsi
wrote a code of laws on bamboo slips;
鄭國用之
the state adopted it.

數難子產之治
He often criticised Tzǔ-ch’an’s administration;
子產屈之
Tzǔ-ch’an bowed to his criticisms.

子產
執而戮之
俄而誅之
But suddenly Tzu-ch’an
arrested
and executed him.

***

然則
子產
非能用竹刑
不得不用
Thus
it is not that Tzǔ-ch’an
was able to adopt his law code,
鄧析
非能屈子產
不得不屈
nor that Teng Hsi
was able to make him bow to criticism,
子產
非能誅鄧析
不得不誅也
nor that Tzǔ-ch’an
was able to execute Teng Hsi;
they could not have acted otherwise.

可以生而生
天福也
可以死而死
天福也
To live and die
at the right time
is a blessing from heaven.

可以生而不生
天罰也
可以死而不死
天罰也
Not to live when it is time to live,
not to die when it is time to die,
is a punishment from heaven.

可以生
可以死
得生
得死
有矣
Some get life
and death
at the right times,
不可以生
不可以死
或死
或生
有矣
some live
and die
when it is not time to live
and die.

然而生生
死死
非物
非我
But it is neither other things
nor ourselves
that give us life when we live
and death when we die;
皆命也
智之所无柰何
both are destined,
wisdom can do nothing about them.

故曰
Hence it is said:

> 窈然
无際
‘Inscrutably,
in endless sequence,
天道自會
They come to pass of themselves by the Way of Heaven.
漠然
无分
Indifferently,
the unbroken circle
天道自運
Turns of itself by the Way of Heaven.
天地不能犯
Heaven and earth cannot offend against this,
聖智不能干
The wisdom of sages cannot defy this,
鬼魅不能欺
Demons and goblins cannot cheat this.
自然者
Being of themselves as they are
默之
成之
Silently
brings them about,
平之
寧之
Gives them serenity,
gives them peace,
將之
迎之
Escorts them as they go
and welcomes them as they come.’

楊朱之友曰季梁
季梁得疾
Yang Chu’s friend Chi Liang
fell ill.

十日
大漸
After seven days,
when the crisis arrived,
其子環而泣之
請醫
his sons stood in a circle round him weeping
and asking him to call a doctor.

季梁
謂楊朱曰
吾子不肖如此之甚
‘Look how foolish my sons are!’
Chi Liang
said to Yang Chu.

汝奚不為我歌
以曉之
‘Why don’t you compose a song for me
which will help them to understand?’

***

楊朱歌曰
Yang Chu sang:

> 天其弗識
‘What heaven does not know
人胡能覺
How can man discern?
匪祐自天
Blessings do not come from heaven,
弗孽由人
Nor calamities from the sins of men.
我乎汝乎
其弗知乎
Is it you and I
who are ignorant?
醫乎巫乎
其知之乎
Do doctors and shamans
understand?’

***

其子弗曉
終謁三醫
Chi Liang’s sons did not see the point,
and finally called three doctors
一曰矯氏
二曰俞氏
三曰盧氏
named Chiao,
Yü
and Lu
診其所疾
to feel his pulse and diagnose the illness.

***

矯氏
謂季梁曰
Mr Chiao
said to Chi Liang:

***

汝寒溫
不節
虛實失度
‘Your temperature,
and the filling and emptying of your vital forces,
are out of order.

病由
飢飽
色欲精
慮煩散
The illness is due to
irregular meals,
sexual over-indulgence,
and worrying too much.

非天
非鬼
It is not the work of heaven
or of spirits,
雖漸
可攻也
and although critical
it can be cured.’

***

季梁曰
眾醫也
‘The usual sort of doctor!’
said Chi Liang.

亟屏之
‘Get rid of him at once.’

***

俞氏曰
Mr Yü said:

***

女始
則胎氣不足
乳湩有餘
‘At your birth
there was too little vital fluid in your mother’s womb
and too much milk in your mother’s breast.

病
非一朝一夕之故
The illness
is not a matter of one morning or evening;
其所由來漸矣
弗可已也
its development has been gradual
and is irreversible.’

***

季梁曰
良醫也
‘A good doctor!’
said Chi Liang.

且食之
‘Let him stay for dinner.’

***

盧氏曰
Mr Lu said:

***

汝疾不由天
亦不由人
亦不由鬼
‘Your illness is not from heaven,
nor from man,
nor from spirits.

稟生受形
既有制之者矣
亦有知之者矣
Ever since you were endowed with life and a body,
you have known
what it is that governs them.

藥石其如汝何
What can medicine and the needle do for you?’

***

季梁曰
神醫也
‘A divine doctor!’
said Chi Liang.

重貺遣之
‘Send him off with a rich present.’

***

俄而季梁之疾自瘳
Soon afterwards Chi Liang’s illness mended of itself.

***

生非貴之所能存
身非愛之所能厚
Valuing life cannot preserve it,
taking care of the body cannot do it good;
生亦非賤之所能夭
身亦非輕之所能薄
scorning life cannot shorten it,
neglecting the body cannot do it harm.

故
貴之或不生
賤之或不死
Hence
some who value life do not live,
some who scorn it do not die,
愛之亦不厚
輕之或不薄
some who take care of the body do it no good,
some who neglect it do it no harm.

此似反也
非反也
This seems unreasonable,
but it is not;
此
自生自死
自厚自薄
in these cases
life and death,
good and harm,
come of themselves.

***

或貴之而生
或賤之而死
Some value life and live,
some scorn it and die,
或愛之而厚
或輕之而薄
some take care of the body and do it good,
some neglect it and do it harm.

此似順也
非順也
This seems only reasonable but it is not;
此亦
自生自死
自厚自薄
in these cases also
life and death,
good and harm,
come of themselves.

Estimating chances makes no difference.’

They meant

Yang Pu
asked his elder brother Yang Chu:

‘Take the case of two men,

隨所不為
however we act
or do not act,
日去
日來
coming one day
and gone the next
孰能知其故
皆命也
no one knows why,
is destiny.

夫信命者
亡壽夭
For the man who trusts destiny,
there is no difference between long life and short;
信理者
亡是非
for one who trusts the principles by which things happen,
nothing to approve or reject;
信心者
亡逆順
for one who trusts his mind,
nothing which is agreeable or offensive;
信性者
亡安危
for one who trusts his nature,
nothing which secures or endangers him.

則謂之
都亡所信
都亡所不信
Then we may say that
there is nothing at all which he either trusts
or distrusts.

真矣
愨矣
He is true,
he is genuine;
奚去奚就
奚哀奚樂
奚為奚不為
what should he shun or approach,
enjoy or grieve over,
do or not do?’

黃帝之書云
The _Book of the Yellow Emperor_ says:

***

至人居若死
動若械
‘The highest man at rest is as though dead,
in movement is like a machine.

亦不知所以居
亦不知所以不居
He knows neither why he is at rest
nor why he is not,
亦不知所以動
亦不知所以不動
why he is in movement
nor why he is not.

亦不以眾人之觀
易其情貌
He neither changes his feelings and expression
because ordinary people are watching,
亦不謂眾人之不觀
不易其情貌
nor fails to change them
because ordinary people are not watching.

獨往獨來
獨出獨入
He comes alone and goes alone,
comes out alone and goes in alone;
孰能礙之
what can obstruct him?’

胥如志也
went about together in the world,
each following his own bent.

窮年
不相知情
自以智之深也
To the end of their lives
they never understood each other,
for each was satisfied of the profundity of his own wisdom.

***

巧佞愚直
婩斫便辟
四人
Four men,
Tricky and Simple,
Tactless and Fawning,
相與游於世
胥如志也
went about together in the world,
each following his own bent.

窮年
而不相語術
自以巧之微也
To the end of their lives
they never discussed their methods,
for each was assured of the subtlety of his own skill.

***

㺒㤉情露
謇極凌誶

Four men,
Underhand and Frank,
Tongue-tied and Brow-beater,
相與游於世
胥如志也
went about together in the world,
each following his own bent.

窮年
不相曉悟
自以為才之得也
To the end of their lives
they never explained themselves to each other,
for each was convinced that his talents would win him success.

***

眠娗諈諉
勇敢怯疑
四人
Four men,
Cheeky and Stolid,
Daring and Timid,
相與游於世
胥如志也
went about together in the world,
each following his own bent.

窮年
不相讁發
自以行无戾也
To the end of their lives
they never pointed out each other’s faults,
for each of them supposed that his conduct was irreproachable.

***

多偶自專
乘權隻立
四人
Four men,
Hanger-on and By-himself,
Privileged and On-his-own,
相與游於世
胥如志也
went about together in the world,
each following his own bent.

窮年
不相顧眄
自以時之適也
To the end of their lives
they never took a close look at each other,
for each of them thought that his behaviour suited the times.

***

此眾態也
其貌不一
These various attitudes
are outwardly very different,
而咸之於道
命所歸也
yet all these men travelled on the Way
in the direction destined for them.

***

佹佹成者
俏成也
初非成也
Success on one side
seems to be success,
but fundamentally it is not.

佹佹敗者
俏敗者也
初非敗也
Failure on one side
seems to be failure,
but fundamentally it is not.

故迷生於俏
Hence error is born from seeming.

俏之際昧然
The division between seeming and truth is confused;
於俏而不昧然
則不駭外禍
不喜內福
but if you are not confused by seeming,
you will not be shocked when misfortune befalls you,
will not rejoice in the good fortune you have achieved.

***

隨時動
隨時止
智不能知也
Wisdom cannot know
the time to act
and the time to stop.

信命者
於彼我无二心
He who trusts destiny
does not think of the things outside him in one way
and of himself in another.

於彼我而有二心者
不若揜目塞耳
背坂面隍
Rather than think of them in different ways,
it is better to cover your eyes and stop up your ears,
and stand with your back to the city wall facing the moat;
亦不墜仆也
you will not fall over.

***

故曰
Hence it is said:
死生自命也
貧窮自時也
‘Death and life depend on destiny,
riches and poverty depend on the times.’

怨夭折者
不知命者也
He who resents being cut off in his prime
does not know destiny.

怨貧窮者
不知時者也
He who resents poverty and distress
does not know the times.

當死不懼
在窮不戚
知命安時也
To meet death unafraid,
to live in distress without caring,
is to know destiny and accept what time brings.

***

其使多智之人
量利害
料虛實
度人情
Men of much knowledge,
who measure benefit and harm,
estimate fact and falsehood,
and calculate the feelings of others,
得亦中
亡亦中
lose as often
as they win.

其少智之人
不量利害
不料虛實
不度人情
Men of little knowledge,
who do not,
得亦中
亡亦中
win as often
as they lose.

量與不量
料與不料
度與不度
奚以異
What difference does it make whether or not
you measure,
estimate
and calculate?

唯亡所量
亡所不量
則全而亡喪
If only you measure nothing
and so measure everything,
you will be complete and without deficiency.

亦非知全
亦非知喪
But it is not by knowledge that one is complete
or deficient;
自全也
自亡也
自喪也
completeness
and deficiency
come of themselves.

齊景公
游於牛山
Duke Ching of Ch’i
went on an excursion to Ox Mountain.

北臨其國城
而流涕曰
He looked Northward down on the walls of his capital,
and said with tears streaming:

***

美哉
國乎
‘How beautiful,
this city of mine,
鬱鬱
芊芊
teeming
and thriving!

若何滴滴
去此國而死乎
Why must the drops fall one by one,
why must I some day leave this city and die?

使古无死者
寡人將去斯而之何
If from of old there had been no death,
should I ever leave it for another?’

***

史孔
梁丘據
皆從而泣
曰
Shih K’ung
and Liang-ch’iu Chü
both followed his example and wept,
saying:

***

臣賴君之賜
䟽食
惡肉
可得而食也
‘Your servants owe it to your bounty
that we are lucky enough to have
tough meat
and coarse rice
to eat,
駑馬
稜車
可得而乘也
jaded hacks
and plain carriages
to ride.

且猶不欲死
而況吾君乎
Yet even we do not wish to die,
and how much less our master!’

***

晏子獨笑於旁
Yen-tzǔ alone was smiling to himself.

公雪涕
而顧晏子曰
The Duke wiped away his tears,
turned to Yen-tzǔ and said:

***

寡人今日之游悲
‘My excursion today has been a melancholy one.

孔與據皆從寡人而泣
子之獨笑何也
K’ung and Chü both wept as I did;
why should you alone be smiling?’

***

晏子對曰
使賢者
常守之
‘If by merit
we could hold on to life,’
Yen-tzǔ answered,
則太公
桓公
將常守之矣
‘your ancestors T’ai-kung
and Duke Huan
would have lived for ever.

使有勇者
而常守之
If by courage
we could hold on to life,
則莊公
靈公
將常守之矣
Duke Chuang
and Duke Ling
would have lived for ever.

數君者
將守之
If these princes
had held on to life,
吾君方將被蓑笠而立乎
畎畝之中
唯事之恤
行假念死乎
my lord would now be standing in the ricefields
wearing a grass coat and bamboo hat,
caring about nothing but his work,
with no time to think about death!

則吾君又安得此位而立焉
For how does my lord come to be sitting on this throne?

以其迭處之
迭去之
至於君也
Because your ancestors occupied
and left it one after another
until it was your turn;
而獨為之流涕
是不仁也
and it is ignoble
that you should be the only one to shed tears over it.

見不仁之君
見諂諛之臣
I see an ignoble lord
and flattering ministers;
臣見此二者
臣之所為獨竊笑也
and this sight
is the reason why I alone ventured to smile.’

***

景公慚焉
Duke Ching was ashamed of himself.

舉觴自罰
罰二臣者
各二觴焉
He lifted his winecup and sconced himself,
and sconced his two ministers
two cups each.

魏人有
東門吳者
There was a man of Wei,
Tung-men Wu,
其子死
而不憂
who did not grieve
when his son died.

其相室曰
His wife said to him:

***

公之愛子也
天下无有
‘No one in the world
loved his son as much as you did.

今子死
不憂何也
Why do you not grieve
now he is dead?’

***

東門吳曰
吾常无子
无子之時不憂
‘I used to have no son,’
he answered,
‘and when I had no son I did not grieve.

今子死
乃與嚮无子同
Now that he is dead,
it is the same as it was before when I had no son.

臣奚憂焉
Why should I grieve over him?’

---

農赴時
商趣利
Farmers hurry to keep up with the seasons,
merchants run after profit,
工追術
仕逐勢
craftsmen chase new skills,
officials hunt power;
勢使然也
the pressure of their circumstances makes this so.

然農有水旱
商有得失
But farmers meet with both water and drought,
merchants with both gain and loss,
工有成敗
仕有遇否
craftsmen with both success and failure,
officials with both good luck and ill;
命使然也
destiny makes this so.
