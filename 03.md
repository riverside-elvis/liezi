## 周穆王 King Mu of Chou

周穆王時
西極之國
有化人來
In the time of King Mu of Chou,
there came from a country in the far West
a magician who could
入水火
貫金石
enter fire and water,
and pierce metal and stone,
反山川
移城邑
who overturned mountains, turned back rivers,
shifted walled cities,
乘虛不墜
觸實不硋
who rode the empty air without falling
and passed unhindered through solid objects;

千變
萬化
不可窮極
there was no end
to the thousands and myriads of ways
in which he altered things
and transformed them.

既已變物之形
又且易人之慮
He not only altered the shapes of things,
he also changed the thoughts of men.

穆王敬之若神
事之若君
King Mu reverenced him as though he were a god,
served him as though he were his prince;
推路寢以居之
引三牲以進之
選女樂以娛之
he lodged him in the royal chambers,
presented him with the flesh of animals bred for sacrifice,
picked singing girls to entertain him.

化人以為
王之宮室卑陋
而不可處
But the magician found
the rooms of the royal palace
too mean and humble to live in,
王之廚饌腥螻
而不可饗
the delicacies of the royal kitchen
too tough and rank to eat,
王之嬪御膻惡
而不可親
the ladies of the royal harem
too ugly and smelly for intimacy.

穆王乃為之改築
土木之功
赭堊之色
无遺巧焉
Then King Mu built him a new mansion,
devoting to it all the skill of his craftsmen
in clay and wood and decorators
in red ochre and whitewash;
五府為虛
而臺始成
his treasuries were empty
by the time the tower was finished.

其高千仞
臨終南之上
號曰中天之臺
It was seven thousand feet high,
overlooked the tops of the Chuang-nan mountains,
and was called ‘The Tower in the Middle Sky’.

〼[^rse-3-1]
鄭衛之
處子娥媌靡曼者
The King chose
the loveliest and daintiest virgins
of Cheng and Wei to fill it,
施芳澤
正娥眉
put fragrant oils on their hair,
straightened their moth eyebrows,
設笄珥
衣阿錫
曳齊紈
adorned them with hairpins and earrings,
dressed them in fine cotton and gauze
bordered with the white silk of Ch’i,

粉白
黛黑
珮玉環
雜芷若以滿之
powdered their faces
and blackened their eyebrows,
hung their girdles with jade rings,
sprinkled them with sweet herbs.

奏
承雲
六瑩
He performed
_Receiving the Clouds_,
the _Six Jewels_,
九韶
晨露
以樂之
the _Nine Succession Dances_
and the _Morning Dew_
to please the magician,
月月獻玉衣
旦旦薦玉食
and every month offered him costly garments,
every morning served him with costly foods.

化人猶不舍然
不得已而臨之居
The magician was still dissatisfied,
but deigned to accept the mansion
in the absence of anything better.

***

亡幾何
謁王同游
Not long afterwards,
he invited the King to come with him on an excursion.

王執化人之袪
騰
而上者中天迺止
He soared upwards,
with King Mu clinging to his sleeve,
and did not stop until they were in the middle sky.

暨及化人之宮
There they came to the magician’s palace.

化人之宮
構以金銀
絡以珠玉
It was built of gold and silver,
and strung with pearls and jades;
出雲雨之上
而不知下之所據
it stood out above the clouds and the rain,
and one could not tell what supported it underneath.

望之若屯雲焉
In the distance it looked like a congealed cloud.

耳目所觀聽
鼻口所納嘗
皆非人閒之有
All that the eye observed and the ear listened to,
the nose inhaled and the tongue tasted,
were things unknown in the world of men.

王實以為
清都
紫微
鈞天廣樂
帝之所居
The King really believed that he was enjoying
‘the mighty music of the innermost heaven’,[^3-1]
in the Pure City
or the Purple Star,
the palaces where God dwells.

王俯而視之
其宮榭
若累塊積蘇焉
When he looked down,
his own palaces and arbours
were like rows of clods and heaps of brushwood.

***

王自以
居數十年
不思其國也
When it seemed to the King
that he had lived there twenty or thirty years
without thinking of his own country,
化人復謁王
同游
the magician again invited him
to accompany him on an excursion.

所及之處
仰不見日月
俯不見河海
They came to a place
where they could not see the sun and moon above them,
nor the rivers and seas below them.

光影所照
王目眩不能得視
Lights and shadows glared,
till the King’s eyes were dazzled and he could not look;
音響所來
王耳亂不能得聽
noises echoed towards them,
till the King’s ears hummed and he could not listen.

百骸六藏悸而不凝
意迷精喪
Every member and organ loosened in terror,
his thoughts ran riot and his spirits waned;
請化人求還
and he asked the magician to let him go back.

化人移之
王若殞虛焉
The magician gave him a push,
and the King seemed to meteor through space.

***

既寤
所坐猶嚮者之處
侍御猶嚮者之人
When he awoke,
he was sitting as before in his own palace,
and his own attendants waited at his side.

視其前
He looked in front of him;
則酒未清
肴未昲
the wine had not yet cooled,
the meats had not yet gone dry.

王問所從來
左右曰
When the King asked where he had been,
his courtiers answered:

***

王默存耳
‘Your Majesty has only been sitting here absorbed in something.’

***

由此穆王自失者
三月而復
From this time King Mu was not himself,
and it was three months before he recovered.

更問化人
化人曰
He again questioned the magician,
who answered:

***

吾與王神游也
‘Your Majesty has been with me on a journey of the spirit.

形奚動哉
Why should your body have moved?

且曩之所居
奚異王之宮
Why should the place where you lived
be different from your own palace,
曩之所游
奚異王之圃
or the place of our excursion
different from your own park?

王閒恆有
疑蹔亡
Your Majesty feels at home with the permanent,
is suspicious of the sudden and temporary.

變化之極
徐疾之閒
可盡模哉
But can one always measure
how far and how fast a scene may alter
and turn into something else?’

***

王大悅
不恤國事
不樂臣妾
肆意遠游
The King was delighted,
ceased to care for state affairs,
took no pleasure in his ministers and concubines,
and gave up his thoughts to far journeys.

命駕八駿之乘
He gave orders to yoke his eight noble horses in two teams.

右服驊騮
而左綠耳
In the team of the royal car,
the inside horses were Blossom Red on the right
and Green Ears on the left;
右驂赤驥
而左白〼[^rse-3-2]
the outside horses were Red Thoroughbred on the right
and White Offering on the left.

王主車則造父為御
〼〼[^rse-3-3]為右
The charioteer was Tsao-fu,
with T’ai-ping to second him.

次車之乘
右服渠黃
而左踰輪
In the team of the next car,
the inside horses were Tall Yellow on the right
and Outstripper on the left;
左驂盜驪
而右山子
the outside horses were Dull Sable on the right
and Son of the Hills on the left.

柏夭主車
參百為御
奔戎為右
Po Yao was in charge,
with Shen Pei as charioteer
and Pen Jung to second him.

***

馳驅千里
至於巨蒐氏之國
They galloped a thousand miles,
and came to the country of the Chü-sou tribe.

巨蒐氏乃獻
白鵠之血以飲王
具牛馬之湩以洗王之足
The tribesmen offered the King
the blood of white snowgeese to drink,
and provided cow and mare milk to wash his feet;
及二乘之人
and they did the same for the men of the two teams.

已飲而行
遂宿于崑崙之阿
赤水之陽
After drinking he went on,
and lodged for the night on the range of K’un-lun,
to the North of the Red River.

別日升于崑崙之丘
以觀黃帝之宮
On another day he climbed the summit of K’un-lun
to look at the Yellow Emperor’s palace,
而封之
以詒後世
and raised a mound there
as a memorial for future generations.

***

遂賓于西王母
觴于瑤池之上
Then he was the guest of the Western Queen Mother[^3-2]
who gave a banquet for him on Jasper Lake.

西王母為王謠
王和之
The Western Queen Mother sang for the King,
who sang in answer;
其辭哀焉
but the words of his song were melancholy.

西觀
日之所入
一日行萬里
He looked Westward at Mount Yen,
where the sun goes down
after its daily journey of ten thousand miles.

王乃歎曰
Then he sighed and said:

於乎
‘Alas!

予
一人不盈于德
而諧於樂
I,
who am King,
have neglected virtue for pleasure.

後世其追數吾過乎
Will not future generations look back
and blame me for my errors?’

***

穆王幾神人哉
How can we call King Mu a Divine Man!

能窮當身之樂
猶百年乃徂
He was able to enjoy his lifetime to the full,
but still he died when his hundred years was up.

世以為登假焉
The world supposed that he had ‘risen into the sky’.[^3-3]

[^rse-3-1]: U+25CD1 (⿱竹閒) in _Sibu congkan_.

[^rse-3-2]: U+23698 (⿱減木) in _Sibu congkan_.

[^rse-3-3]: ‘T’ai’ is U+27BBC (⿱㐫⿵冂谷) in _Sibu congkan_,
and might be U+2164C (⿱大⿵〼〼氺) in _Concordance_,
and ‘ping’ is U+20726 (⿱刀⿵冂) in _Sibu congkan_,
but is emended in _Concordance_ to a character I can’t find,
but looks a bit like (⿱內內).

[^3-1]: A reference to the dream of Chao Chien-tzǔ (6th century B.C.).
‘I went to the home of God,
and in extreme delight
wandered with all the spirits in the Level Heaven
(the innermost of the nine divisions of heaven).
The mighty music,
the Nine Performances,
the myriad dances,
were altogether different from
the music of the Three Dynasties;
their notes moved my heart.’

[^3-2]: The Western Queen Mother (Hsi-wang-tnu) was not yet,
as she became in later Chinese legend,
a beautiful fairy queen.
The fourth-century commentator Chang Chan
still accepts the description of the old
_Classic of the Mountains and Seas_:
‘The Western Queen Mother has human shape,
with a leopard’s tail;
she has tigers’ teeth and a formidable snarl,
and wears a headdress over her tangled hair.’

[^3-3]: Flown into the sky as an immortal.
Unlike the Yellow Emperor,
who did become an immortal (p. 35 above),
the pleasure-loving King Mu never profited by his dream.

老成子
學幻於尹文先生
三年不告
Lao-ch’eng-tzǔ
studied magic under Master Yin Wen,
who told him nothing for three years.

老成子請其過
而求退
Lao-ch’eng-tzǔ asked what he had done wrong
and offered to leave.

尹文先生揖而進之於室
屏左右
而與之言曰
Master Yin Wen bowed him into the house,
shut the door on his attendants,
and talked with him.

***

昔
老聃之徂西也
顧而告予曰
‘Formerly,
as Lao-tzǔ was setting out for the West,
he looked back and told me:

有生之氣
有形之狀
盡幻也
The breath of all that lives,
the appearance of all that has shape,
is illusion.

造化之所始
陰陽之所變者
謂之生
謂之死
What is begun by the creative process,
and changed by the Yin and Yang,
is said to be born
and to die;
窮數達變
因形移易者
謂之化
謂之幻
things which, already shaped, are displaced and replaced
by a comprehension of numbers and understanding of change,
are said to be transformed,
to be illusions of magic.

造物者
其巧妙
其功深
固難窮
難終
The skill of the Creator
is inscrutable,
his achievement profound,
so that it is long before his work completes its term
and comes to an end.

因形者
其巧顯
其功淺
故隨起
隨滅
The skill of the magician working on the shapes of things
is obvious
but his achievement shallow,
so that his work is extinguished
as soon as it is conjured up.

知
幻化之
不異生死也
始可與學幻矣
It is when you realise
that the illusions and transformations of magic
are no different from birth and death
that it becomes worthwhile to study magic with you.

吾與汝亦幻也
奚須學哉
You and I are also illusion;
what is there to study?’

***

老成子
歸用尹文先生之言
深思三月
Lao-ch’eng-tzǔ
went home to practise Master Yin Wen’s teaching,
and after pondering deeply for three months,
遂能存亡自在
憣校四時
冬起雷
夏造冰
was able to appear and disappear at will
and turn round and exchange the four seasons,
call up thunder in winter,
create ice in summer,
飛者走
走者飛
make flying things run
and running things fly.

終身不箸其術
固世莫傳焉
He never disclosed his arts all his life,
so that no one handed them down to later generations.

子列子曰
Lieh-tzǔ said:

***

善為化者
其道密庸
其功同人
‘As for those sages who had the art of transforming the Empire,
their Way was employed in secret,
their outward achievements were no different from other men’s.

五帝之德
三王之功
The power of the Five Emperors,
the achievements of the Three Kings,
未必
盡智勇之力
were not necessarily all due
to the force of their wisdom and courage.

或由化而成
Some they accomplished through their transforming influence;
孰測之哉
who has fathomed them?’

---

覺有八徵
夢有六候
There are eight proofs of being awake,
six tests of dreaming.

奚謂八徵
What is meant by the eight proofs?

一曰故
二曰為
They are events
and actions,
三曰得
四曰喪
gain
and loss,
五曰哀
六曰樂
sorrow
and joy,
七曰生
八曰死
birth
and death.

此者八徵
形所接也
These eight happen
when the body encounters something.

奚謂六候
What is meant by the six tests?

一曰正夢
二曰蘁夢
There are normal dreams,
and dreams due to alarm,
三曰思夢
四曰寤夢
thinking,
memory,
五曰喜夢
六曰懼夢
rejoicing,
fear.

此六者
神所交也
These six happen
when the spirit connects with something.

不識
感變之所起者
事至則惑其所由然
Those who do not recognise
where the changes excited in them come from
are perplexed about the reason when an event arrives.

識
感變之所起者
事至則知其所由然
Those who do recognise
where they come from
do know the reason;
知其所由然
則無所怛
and if you know the reason,
nothing will startle you.

***

一體之
盈虛
消息
When a body’s energies
fill and empty,
diminish and grow,
皆通於天地
應於物類
they always communicate with heaven and earth,
responding to the different classes of things.

故陰氣壯
則夢涉大水而恐懼
Therefore when the Yin energy is strong,
you are frightened by dreams of walking through great waters.

陽氣壯
則夢涉大火而燔焫
When the Yang energy is strong,
you are roasted by dreams of walking through great fires.

陰陽俱壯
則夢生殺
When the Yin and Yang are both strong,
you dream of killing or sparing.

甚飽
則夢與
When you overeat,
you dream of giving presents;
甚饑
則夢取
when you starve,
of receiving them.

是以
以浮虛為疾者
則夢揚
For the same reason,
when you suffer from giddiness,
you dream of floating in the air;
以沈實為疾者
則夢溺
from a sinking,
congested feeling,
of drowning.

藉帶而寢
則夢蛇
When you go to sleep lying on your belt,
you dream of snakes;
飛鳥銜髮
則夢飛
when a flying bird pecks your hair,
of flying.

將陰夢火
將疾夢食
As it turns dark you dream of fire,
falling ill you dream of eating;
飲酒者憂
歌儛者哭
after drinking wine you are anxious,
after singing and dancing you weep.

***

子列子曰
Lieh-tzǔ said:

***

神遇
為夢
‘The spirit chances on it,
and we dream;
形接
為事
the body encounters it,
and it happens.

故晝想
夜夢
神形所遇
Hence by day we imagine
and by night dream
what spirit and body chance upon.

故
神凝者
想夢自消
That is why,
when someone’s spirit is concentrated,
imagination and dreaming diminish of themselves.

信覺不語
信夢不達
物化之往來者也
What those who trust the time when they are awake do not explain,
and those who trust in dreams do not fathom,
is the arrival and passing of the transformations of things.

古之真人
其覺自忘
其寢不夢
幾虛語哉
It is no empty saying that
the True Men of old
forgot themselves when awake
and did not dream when they slept!’

---

西極之南隅有國焉
不知境界之所接
At the South corner of the far West there is a country,
I do not know where its frontiers lie:
名古莽之國
it is named the country of Ku-mang.

陰陽之氣所不交
故寒暑亡辨
The Yin and Yang breaths do not meet there,
so there is no distinction between cold and heat.

日月之光所不照
故晝夜亡辨
The light of the sun and moon does not shine there,
so there is no distinction between day and night.

其民
不食
不衣
而多眠
五旬一覺
Its people
do not eat
or wear clothes
and sleep most of the time,
waking once in fifty days.

以夢中所為者實
覺之所見者妄
They think that what they do in dreams is real,
and what they see waking is unreal.

***

四海之齊
謂中央之國
The place equidistant from the four seas
is called the Central Kingdom.[^3-4]

跨河南北
越岱東西
萬有餘里
It goes North and South across the Yellow River,
East and West over Mount T’ai,
for more than ten thousand miles.

其陰陽之審度
故一寒一暑
The Yin and Yang are truly proportioned there,
so there is alternation of cold and heat.

昏明之分察
故一晝一夜
Darkness and light are rightly divided there,
so there is alternation of day and night.

其民
有智
有愚
Of its people
some are wise
and some are foolish.

萬物滋殖
才藝多方
The myriad things thrive and multiply,
there are many kinds of skill and talent,
有君臣相臨
禮法相持
there are rulers and ministers to oversee them,
manners and laws to support them;
其所云為
不可稱計
what they say and do
is past telling and counting.

一覺一寐
They wake and sleep in alternation;
以為覺之所為者實
夢之所見者妄
and they think that what they do waking is real,
and what they see in dreams is unreal.

***

東極之北隅有國
曰阜落之國
In the North corner of the far East
there is a country called the country of Fu-lo.

其土氣常燠
日月餘光之照其土
Its climate is always hot,
for the excess of the light of sun and moon shines there.

不生嘉苗
Its soil will not grow fine crops;
其民食草根木實
不知火食
its people eat herbs and roots and fruit from the trees,
and do not know how to cook with fire.

性剛悍
彊弱相藉
貴勝
而不尚義
By nature they are hard and fierce,
the strong oppress the weak,
they honour the victor
and do not respect right.

多馳步
少休息
They travel at a gallop most of the time
and seldom rest;
常覺而不眠
they are always awake and never sleep.

[^3-4]: China.

周之尹氏
大治產
Mr Yin of Chou
ran a huge estate.

其下趣役者
侵晨昏而弗息
The underlings who hurried to serve him
never rested from dawn to dusk.

有老役夫
筋力竭矣
而使之彌勤
There was an old servant
with no more strength in his muscles,
whom he drove all the harder.

晝則呻呼而即事
夜則昏憊而熟寐
By day the servant went to work groaning,
at night he slept soundly dulled by fatigue.

精神荒散
昔昔夢為國君
Losing consciousness,
every evening he dreamed that he was lord of the state,
居人民之上
總一國之事
enthroned above the people,
with all affairs of state under his control.

遊燕
宮觀
恣意所欲
He gave himself up to whatever pleased him,
excursions and banquets,
palaces and spectacles;
其樂无比
his joy was incomparable.

覺
則復役
Waking,
he was a servant again.

***

人有慰喻其懃者
役夫曰
When someone condoled with him for having to work so hard,
the servant said:

***

人生百年
晝夜各分
‘Man’s term of life is a hundred years,
divided between day and night.

吾晝為僕虜
苦則苦矣
By day I am a bondman,
and my life is bitter indeed;
夜為人君
其樂无比
but at night I become a prince,
and my joy is incomparable.

何所怨哉
Why should I complain?’

***

尹氏心營世事
慮鍾家業
心形俱疲
Mr Yin’s mind was vexed by worldly affairs,
his thoughts occupied with the family inheritance,
which exhausted him body and mind;
夜亦昏憊而寐
and at night he too fell fast asleep dulled by fatigue.

昔昔夢為人僕
And every evening he dreamed that he was a slave,
趨走作役
无不為也
harried
by every conceivable task,
數罵杖撻
无不至也
scolded and beaten
for every imaginable fault.

眠中啽囈呻呼
徹旦息焉
He muttered and groaned in his sleep,
and there was no relief until dawn.

尹氏病之
以訪其友
友曰
Distressed by this,
Mr Yin consulted a friend,
who told him:

***

若位足榮身
資財有餘
勝人遠矣
‘With rank high enough to distinguish you,
and more property than you need,
you are too far above other men.

夜夢為僕
苦逸之復
數之常也
Dreaming at night that you are a slave,
reverting from case to toil,
is fortune righting itself.

若欲覺夢兼之
豈可得邪
Can you reasonably expect to have it both ways,
dreaming as well as awake?’

***

尹氏聞其友言
寬其役夫之程
減己思慮之事
After hearing his friend’s advice,
Mr Yin eased his demands on the servants
and reduced the responsibilities which worried him.

疾並少閒
His ailment took a turn for the better.

鄭人
有薪於野者
遇駭鹿
There was a man of Cheng
who went to gather firewood in the moors,
and came on a frightened deer.

御而
擊之
斃之
He stood in its way,
struck it
and killed it.

恐人見之也
遽而藏諸隍中
覆之以蕉
Fearing that someone would see the deer,
he quickly hid it in a ditch
and covered it with brushwood.

不勝其喜
His joy overwhelmed him.

俄
而遺其所藏之處
遂以為夢焉
But soon afterwards
he could not find the place where he had hidden it,
and decided that he must have been dreaming.

***

順塗而詠其事
He came down the road humming to himself about the affair.

傍人有聞者
用其言而取之
A passer-by heard him,
acted on his words and took the deer.

既歸
告其室人曰
When this man got home
he told his wife:

***

向薪者夢得鹿
而不知其處
‘Just now a woodcutter dreamed he had caught a deer,
but did not know where it was.

吾今得之
Now I have found it.

彼直真夢者矣
His dream was a true one.’

***

室人曰
若將是夢見
薪者之得鹿邪
‘Isn’t it rather that you dreamed
you saw the woodcutter catch the deer?

詎有薪者邪
Why should there be any woodcutter?

今真得鹿
是若之夢真邪
Since you have really got the deer,
isn’t it your dream which was true?’

***

夫曰
吾據得鹿
‘All I know is that I have got it.

何用知彼夢我夢邪
What do I care which of us was dreaming?’

***

薪者之歸
不厭失鹿
When the woodcutter got home,
he was not reconciled to his loss.

其夜真夢
藏之之處
又夢得之之主
That night he had a true dream
of the place where he hid the deer,
and also of the man who found it.

爽旦
案所夢
而尋得之
遂訟
而爭之
Next morning,
guided by the dream,
he sought out the man,
and then went to law
to contest his right to the deer.

***

歸之士師
士師曰
The case was referred to the Chief Justice,
who said:

***

若初真得鹿
妄謂之夢
‘If in the first place you really did catch the deer,
you are wrong to say you were dreaming.

真夢得鹿
妄謂之實
If you really dreamed that you caught it,
you are wrong to say it actually happened.

彼真取若鹿
而與若爭鹿
The other man really did take your deer,
yet contests your right to it.

室人又謂
夢仞人鹿
无人得鹿
His wife also says
that he recognised it in his dream as another man’s deer,
yet denies the existence of the man who caught it.

今據有此鹿
Now all I know is that here we have the deer.

請二分之
I suggest you divide it between you.’

***

以聞鄭君
鄭君曰
It was reported to the lord of Cheng,
who said:

***

嘻
‘Alas!

士師
將復夢分人鹿乎
Is the Chief Justice
going to dream that he has divided someone’s deer?’

訪之國相
The Prime Minister was consulted.

國相曰
He said:

***

夢與不夢
臣所不能辨也
‘It is beyond me
to distinguish dreaming and not dreaming.

欲辨覺夢
唯
黃帝
孔丘
If you want to distinguish dreaming from waking,
you will have to call in
the Yellow Emperor
or Confucius.

今亡
黃帝
孔丘
孰辨之哉
Now that we have lost
the Yellow Emperor
and Confucius,
who is to distinguish them?

且
恂士師之言可也
For the present
we may as well trust the decision of the Chief Justice.’

宋陽里華子
中年
病忘
In middle age
Hua-tzǔ of Yang-li in Sung
lost his memory.

朝取
而夕忘
He would receive a present in the morning
and forget it by the evening,
夕與
而朝忘
give a present in the evening
and forget it by the morning.

在塗則忘行
在室則忘坐
In the street he would forget to walk,
at home he would forget to sit down.

今不識先
後不識今
Today he would not remember yesterday,
tomorrow he would not remember today.

闔室毒之
謁史而卜之
弗占
His family were troubled about it,
and invited a diviner to tell his fortune,
but without success.

謁巫而禱之
弗禁
They invited a shaman to perform an auspicious rite,
but it made no difference.

謁醫而攻之
弗已
They invited a doctor to treat him,
but it did no good.

魯有儒生
自媒
能治之
There was a Confucian of Lu who,
acting as his own go-between,
claimed that he could cure it;
華子之妻子
以居產之半
請其方
and Hua-tzǔ’s wife and children
offered half of their property
in return for his skill.

儒生曰
The Confucian told them:

***

此固
非卦兆之所占
非祈請之所禱
非藥石之所攻
‘This is clearly
not a disease which can be divined by hexagrams and omens,
or charmed away by auspicious prayers,
or treated by medicines and the needle.

吾試
化其心
變其慮
I shall try
reforming his mind,
changing his thoughts;
庶幾其瘳乎
there is a good chance that he will recover.’

***

於是試
露之
而求衣
Then the Confucian tried
stripping Hua-tzǔ,
and he looked for his clothes;
饑之
而求食
tried starving him,
and he looked for food;
幽之
而求明
tried shutting him up in the dark,
and he looked for light.

儒生欣然
告其子曰
The Confucian was delighted,
and told the man’s sons:

***

疾可已也
‘The sickness is curable.

然吾之方
密傳世
不以告人
But my arts
have been passed down secretly through the generations,
and are not disclosed to outsiders.

試屏左右
獨與居室七日
I shall shut out his attendants,
and stay alone with him in his room for seven days.’

***

從之
莫知其所施為也
They agreed,
and no one knew what methods the Confucian used;
而積年之疾
一朝都除
but the sickness of many years
was completely dispelled in a single morning.

***

華子既悟
迺大怒
When Hua-tzǔ woke up
he was very angry.

黜妻
罰子
操戈逐儒生
He dismissed his wife,
punished his sons,
and chased away the Confucian with a spear.

宋人執
而問其以
The authorities of Sung arrested him
and wanted to know the reason.

***

華子曰
曩
吾忘也
蕩蕩然
‘Formerly,
when I forgot,’
said Hua-tzǔ,
‘I was boundless;
不覺天地之有无
I did not notice whether heaven and earth existed or not.

今頓識
Now suddenly I remember;
既往數十年來
存亡
得失
哀樂
好惡
擾擾萬緒起矣
and all the disasters and recoveries,
gains and losses,
joys and sorrows,
loves and hates
of twenty or thirty years past
rise up in a thousand tangled threads.

吾恐將來之
存亡
得失
哀樂
好惡之
亂吾心如此也
I fear
that all the disasters and recoveries,
gains and losses,
joys and sorrows,
loves and hates
still to come will confound my heart just as much.

須臾之忘
可復得乎
Shall I never again
find a moment of forgetfulness?’

***

子貢聞而怪之
以告孔子
Tzǔ-kung marvelled when he heard of it
and told Confucius.

***

孔子曰
此非汝所及乎
‘This is beyond the understanding of someone like you,’
said Confucius.

顧謂顏回
記之
He turned to Yen Hui and told him
to note it down.

秦人逢氏
有子少而惠
及壯而有迷罔之疾
Mr P’ang of Ch’in
had a son who was clever as a child
but suffered from an abnormality when he grew up.

聞歌以為哭
視白以為黑
When he heard singing he thought it was weeping,
when he saw white he thought it was black;
饗香以為朽
常甘以為苦
行非以為是
fragrant smells he thought noisome,
sweet tastes he thought bitter,
wrong actions he thought right.

意之所之
天地
四方
水火
寒暑
无不倒錯者焉
Whatever came into his mind,
heaven and earth,
the four cardinal points,
water and fire,
heat and cold,
he always turned upside down.

楊氏告其父曰
A certain Mr Yang told his father:

***

魯之君子
多術藝
將能已乎
‘The gentlemen of Lu[^3-5]
have many arts and skills,
perhaps they can cure him.

汝奚不訪焉
Why not inquire among them?’

***

其父之魯
過陳
遇老聃
因告其子之證
The father set out for Lu,
but passing through Ch’en
he came across Lao-tzǔ,
and took the opportunity to tell him about his son’s symptoms.

***

老聃曰
汝庸知汝子之迷乎
‘How do you know that your son is abnormal?’
said Lao-tzǔ.

今天下之人
皆惑於是非
昏於利害
‘Nowadays everyone in the world
is deluded about right and wrong,
and confused about benefit and harm;
同疾者多
固莫有覺者
because so many people share this sickness,
no one perceives that it is a sickness.

且
一身之迷
不足傾一家
Besides,
one man’s abnormality
is not enough to overturn his family,
一家之迷
不足傾一鄉
one family’s
to overturn the neighbourhood,
一鄉之迷
不足傾一國
one neighbourhood’s
to overturn the state,
一國之迷
不足傾天下
one state’s
to overturn the world.

天下盡迷
孰正之哉
If the whole world were abnormal,
how could abnormality overturn it?

向使天下之人
其心盡如汝子
汝則反迷矣
Supposing the minds of everyone in the world
were like your son’s,
then on the contrary it is you who would be abnormal.

哀樂
聲色
Joy and sorrow,
music and beauty,
臭味
是非
孰能正之
smells and tastes,
right and wrong,
who can straighten them out?

且吾之
此言未必非迷
而況魯之君子
迷之郵者
I am not even sure
that these words of mine are not abnormal,
let alone those of the gentlemen of Lu,
who are the most abnormal of all;
焉能解人之迷哉
who are they to cure other people’s abnormality?

榮汝之糧
不若遄歸也
You had better go straight home
instead of wasting your money.’

[^3-5]: Confucians.
