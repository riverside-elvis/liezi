# Appendix: Transcriber’s Notes

This is a mashup of
A.C. Graham’s _The Book of Lieh-tzǔ_, 1990,
with 四部叢刊 _Sibu congkan_ base text from
[ctext](https://ctext.org/liezi)

Graham’s base text was also _Sibu congkan_,
with variants and emendations from
楊伯峻 Yang Bojun, 列子集釋 _Liezi Jishi_, 1958,
and a few further emendations of his own.

I’ve updated ctext based on emendations listed in
列子逐字索引 _A Concordance to the Liezi_, 1996,
which also follows Yang Bujun, 1991.

I’ve replaced missing (Noto CJK) characters
with the masu mark (〼)
and footnoted them to preserve Unicode code point
and with descriptions of idiographic structure from
[chise.org](https://www.chise.org/).

I’ve removed base text punctuation
and modified phrasing to suit Graham’s phrasing and punctuation.
Paragraph and passage breaks are Graham’s.

Markdown resources and a build script are on
[GitHub](https://github.com/riverside-elvis/liezi).
