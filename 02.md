## 黄帝 The Yellow Emperor

黃帝即位十有五年
喜天下之戴己
For fifteen years after the Yellow Emperor came to the throne,
it pleased him to be borne on the heads of the Empire.

養正命
娛耳目
供鼻口
He ‘tended life’,[^2-1]
amused his eyes and ears,
pampered his nostrils and mouth,
焦然肌色皯黣
昏然五情爽惑
till his ravaged flesh darkened
and his dulled senses were stupefied.

又十有五年
憂天下之不治
During the next fifteen years
he worried about the misgovernment of the Empire,
竭聰明
進智力
營百姓
and devoted all his eyesight and hearing,
knowledge and strength,
to ruling the people.

焦然肌色皯黣
昏然五情爽惑
But still his ravaged flesh grew darker
and his dulled senses more stupefied.

黃帝乃喟然讚曰
Then the Yellow Emperor breathed a sigh and said:

***

朕之過淫矣
‘Deep is my error!

養一己其患如此
治萬物其患如此
It is an affliction to care for oneself alone,
and as great an affliction to govern the myriad things!’

於是
放萬機
舍宮寢
After this
he refused to concern himself with decisions of policy,
left the Imperial chambers,
去直侍
徹鐘懸
減廚膳
dismissed his attendants,
discarded his orchestra of bells and drums,
reduced the delicacies of his kitchen.

退而間居大庭之館
齋心服形
三月不親政事
He retired to live undisturbed in a hut in his main courtyard,
where he fasted to discipline mind and body,
and for three months had nothing to do with affairs of state.

***

晝寢
而夢遊於華胥氏之國
Falling asleep in the daytime,
he dreamed that he was wandering in the country of Hua-hsü.[^2-2]

華胥氏之國在
弇州之西
台州之北
This country is
to the West of Yen province in the far West,
to the North of T’ai province in the far North West,
不知斯齊國幾千萬里
who knows how many thousands and myriads of miles
from the Middle Kingdom.

蓋非舟車足力之所及
神游而已
It is a place which you cannot reach by boat or carriage or on foot,
only by a journey of the spirit.

其國无師長
In this country there are no teachers and leaders;
自然而已
all things follow their natural course.

其民无嗜慾
The people have no cravings and lusts;
自然而已
all men follow their natural course.

不知樂生
不知惡死
故无夭殤
They are incapable of delighting in life
or hating death,
and therefore none of them dies before his time.

不知親己
不知踈物
故无愛憎
They do not know how to
prefer themselves to others,
and so they neither love nor hate.

不知背逆
不知向順
故无利害
They do not know how to
turn their faces to things or turn their backs,
go with the stream or push against it,
so nothing benefits or harms them.

都无所愛惜
都无所畏忌
There is nothing at all which they grudge or regret,
nothing which they dread or envy.

入水不溺
入火不熱
They go into water without drowning,
into fire without burning;
斫撻无傷痛
hack them, flog them, there is no wound nor pain;
指擿无痟癢
poke them, scratch them, there is no ache nor itch.

乘空如履實
寢虛若處床
They ride space as though walking the solid earth,
sleep on the void as though on their beds;
雲霧不硋其視
雷霆不亂其聽
clouds and mist do not hinder their sight,
thunder does not confuse their hearing,
美惡不滑其心
山谷不躓其步
beauty and ugliness do not disturb their hearts,
mountains and valleys do not trip their feet---
神行而已
for they make only journeys of the spirit.

***

黃帝既寤
怡然自得
When the Yellow Emperor woke,
he was delighted to have found himself.

召天老力牧太山稽
告之曰
He summoned his ministers T’ien-lao, Li-mu and T’ai-shan Chi,
and told them:

***

朕閒居三月
齋心服形
‘I have lived undisturbed for three months,
fasting to discipline mind and body,
思有以養身治物之道
弗獲其術
and meditating a way to care for myself and govern others,
but I did not find a method.

疲而睡
所夢若此
Worn out, I fell asleep,
and this is what I dreamed.

今知至道
不可以情求矣
Now I know that the utmost Way
cannot be sought through the passions.

朕知之矣
朕得之矣
而不能以告若矣
I know it,
I have found it,
but I cannot tell it to you.’

***

又二十有八年
天下大治幾若華胥氏之國
而帝登假
After another twenty-eight years,
when the Empire was almost as well governed
as the country of Hua-hsü,
the Emperor rose into the sky.[^2-3]

百姓號之
二百餘年不輟
The people did not stop wailing for him
for more than two hundred years.

[^2-1]: Lived for pleasure;
cf. p. 143 below.

[^2-2]: Hua-hsü was the mother of Fu-hsi,
the first Emperor.

[^2-3]: Became an immortal.

---

列姑射山在
海河洲中
The Ku-ye mountains stand on
a chain of islands where the Yellow River enters the sea.

山上有神人焉
Upon the mountains there lives a Divine Man,
吸風
飲露
不食五穀
who inhales the wind
and drinks the dew,
and does not eat the five grains.

心如淵泉
形如處女
His mind is like a bottomless spring,
his body is like a virgin’s.

不偎
不愛
仙聖為之臣
He knows neither intimacy
nor love,
yet immortals and sages serve him as ministers.

不畏
不怒
愿愨為之使
He inspires no awe,
he is never angry,
yet the eager and diligent act as his messengers.

不施
不惠
而物自
He is without kindness
and bounty,
but others have enough by themselves;
不聚
不歛
而己无愆
he does not store
and save,
but he himself never lacks.

陰陽常調
日月常明
四時常若
The Yin and Yang are always in tune,
the sun and moon always shine,
the four seasons are always regular,
風雨常均
字育常時
年穀常豐
wind and rain are always temperate,
breeding is always timely,
the harvest is always rich,
而土无札傷
人无夭惡
and there are no plagues to ravage the land,
no early deaths to afflict men,
物无疵厲
鬼无靈響焉
animals have no diseases,
and ghosts have no uncanny echoes.

列子師老商氏
友伯高子
Lieh-tzǔ had Old Shang as teacher,
and Po-kao-tzǔ as his friend.

進二子之道
乘風而歸
When he had nothing more to learn from either of them,
he came home riding the wind.

尹生聞之
從列子居
數月不省舍
Yin Sheng heard of him,
joined his disciples,
and for several months did not look for lodgings.[^2-4]

因間請蘄其術者
十反
Ten times,
when Lieh-tzǔ was not busy,
he took the opportunity to beg for his secrets;
而十不告
and each time
Lieh-tzǔ turned him away and would not tell him.

尹生懟而請辭
Yin Sheng was indignant and took his leave;
列子又不命
Lieh-tzǔ made no objection.

***

尹生退數月意不已
又往從之
A few months after Yin Sheng withdrew
he had not renounced his aim,
and went to join Lieh-tzǔ again.

***

列子曰
汝何去來之頻
‘Why do you keep coming and going?’
Lieh-tzǔ asked him.

***

尹生曰
曩章戴有請於子
子不我告
‘Not long ago I made a request to you,
but you would not tell me.

固有憾於子
今復脫然
It is true that I felt some rancour against you,
but now it is all gone.

是以又來
So I have come again.’

***

列子曰
曩吾以汝為達
‘I used to think you intelligent;
今汝之鄙至此乎
are you really as vulgar as all that?

姬將告汝所學於夫子者矣
Here, I will tell you what I learned from my own Master.

自吾之事夫子友若人也
三年之後
Three years after
I began to serve the Master and befriend a certain man,
心不敢念是非
口不敢言利害
my mind no longer dared to think of right and wrong,
my mouth no longer dared to speak of benefit and harm;
始得夫子一眄而已
and it was only then
that I got as much as a glance from the Master.

五年之後
心庚念是非
口庚言利害
After five years,
my mind was again thinking of right and wrong,
my mouth was again speaking of benefit and harm;
夫子始一解顏而笑
and for the first time
the Master’s face relaxed in a smile.

七年之後
從心之所念
庚无是非
After seven years,
I thought of whatever came into my mind
without any longer distinguishing between right and wrong,
從口之所言
庚无利害
said whatever came into my mouth
without any longer distinguishing between benefit and harm;
夫子始一
引吾並席而坐
and for the first time
the Master pulled me over to sit with him on the same mat.

九年之後
橫心之所念
橫口之所言
After nine years,
I thought without restraint of whatever came into my mind
and said without restraint whatever came into my mouth
亦不知我之是非利害歟
亦不知彼之是非利害歟
亦不知夫子之為我師若人之為我友
without knowing
whether the right and wrong, benefit and harm,
were mine or another’s,
without knowing
that the Master was my teacher
and the man I have mentioned was my friend.

內外進矣
而後
Only then,
when I had come to the end
of everything inside me and outside me,
眼如耳
耳如鼻
鼻如口
my eyes became like my ears,
my ears like my nose,
my nose like my mouth;
无不同也
everything was the same.

心凝形釋
骨肉都融
My mind concentrated and my body relaxed,
bones and flesh fused completely,
不覺
形之所倚
足之所履
I did not notice
what my body leaned against
and my feet trod,
隨風東西
猶木葉幹殼
I drifted with the wind East or West,
like a leaf from a tree or a dry husk,
竟不知
風乘我邪
我乘風乎
and never knew
whether it was the wind that rode me
or I that rode the wind.

***

今女居先生之門
曾未浹時
而懟憾者再三
‘Now you come to be my disciple,
and before even a year has gone round,
you are indignant and resentful time and again.

女之片體將氣所不受
汝之一節將地所不載
The air will refuse your slip of a body,
the earth will refuse to carry one joint of your finger;
履虛乘風其可幾乎
can you hope to tread the void and ride the wind?’

***

尹生甚怍
屏息良久
不敢復言
Yin Sheng was deeply ashamed,
held his breath for a long time,
and did not dare to speak again.

[^2-4]: A disciple was expected
to introduce himself to his teacher
before looking for lodgings.

列子問關尹曰
Lieh-tzǔ asked Kuan-yin:

> 至人潛行不空
‘The highest man walks under-water and does not suffocate,
蹈火不熱
Treads fire and does not burn,
行乎萬物之上而不慄
Walks above the myriad things and does not tremble.

請問何以至於此
May I ask how he achieves this?’

***

關尹曰
是純氣之守也
非智巧果敢之列
‘It is by holding fast to his purest energies;
it has nothing to do with skill and daring.

姬魚語汝
Come, let me tell you.

凡有貌像聲色者
皆物也
Whatever has features, likeness, sound, colour,
is a thing.

物與物何以相遠也
How can one thing put a distance between itself and other things?

夫奚足以至乎先
How can it deserve to get ahead of them?

是色而已
It is mere form and colour.

則物之造乎不形
而止乎无所化
夫得是而窮之者
But one who can grasp and fathom
the Unshaped from which things are created,
the Changeless by which they are brought to a stop---
物焉得而止焉
how can other things succeed in stopping him?

彼將處乎不深之度
而藏乎无端之紀
游乎萬物之所終始
He will cling to his degree and not exceed it,
hide far back along the skein without beginnings,
and roam where the myriad things end and begin;
壹其性
養其氣
含其德
he will unify his nature,
tend his energies,
maintain the virtue inside him,
以通乎物之所造
until he penetrates to the place where things are created.

夫若是者
If you can be like this,
其天守全
其神无郤
the Heaven inside you will keep its integrity,
the spirit inside you will have no flaws;
物奚自入焉
where can other things find a way in?

***

夫醉者之墜於車也
雖疾不死
‘When a drunken man is thrown from a cart,
swiftly though he falls it does not kill him.

骨節與人同
而犯害與人異
其神全也
His bones and joints are the same as another man’s,
yet he is not harmed as another man would be,
because of the integrity of his spirit.

乘亦弗知也
墜亦弗知也
He rides without knowing it,
falls without knowing it;
死生
驚懼
不入乎其胸
life and death,
astonishment and fear,
find no entry into his breast,
是故遌物而不慴
and so he does not shrink from hitting things.

彼得全於酒
而猶若是
而況得全於天乎
If this is true
even of a man who gets his integrity from wine,
how much more is it true of those who get it from Heaven!

聖人藏於天
故物莫之能傷也
The sage hides himself in Heaven,
therefore no thing can harm him.’

---

列禦寇為伯昏无人射
Lieh-tzǔ was demonstrating his archery to Po-hun Wu-jen.

引之盈貫
措杯水其肘上
He drew the bow to the full
and placed a bowl of water on his left forearm.

發之
鏑矢復沓
方矢復寓
After he released the arrow,
he fitted a second arrow to the string, released it,
and fitted a third, while the first was still in flight.

當是時也
猶象人也
The whole time
he was like a statue.

***

伯昏无人曰
是射之射
‘This is the shooting in which you shoot,’
said Po-hun Wu-jen.

非不射之射也
‘It is not the shooting in which you do not shoot.

當與汝登高山
履危石臨百仞之淵
若能射乎
If I climb a high mountain with you,
and tread a perilous cliff overlooking an abyss a thousand feet deep,
will you be able to shoot?’

***

於是无人遂登高山
履危石臨百仞之淵
Then Po-hun Wu-jen did climb a high mountain
and tread a perilous cliff overlooking an abyss a thousand feet deep.

背逡巡足二分垂在外
揖禦寇而進之
He walked backwards until half his foot hung over the edge,
and bowed to Lieh-tzǔ to come forward.

禦寇伏地汗流至踵
Lieh-tzǔ lay on his face with the sweat streaming down to his heels.

伯昏无人曰
Po-hun Wu-jen said:

***

夫至人者
‘The highest man

> 上闚青天
Peers at the blue sky above him,
下潛黃泉
Measures the Yellow Spring[^2-5] below him.
揮斥八極
Tossed and hurled to the Eight Corners,
神氣不變
His spirit and his breathing do not change.

今汝怵然有恂目之志
Now you tremble and would like to shut your eyes.

爾於中也殆矣夫
Isn’t there danger within you?’

[^2-5]: Hades.

范氏有子曰子華
善養私名
舉國服之
There was a man of the Fan family called Tzǔ-hua,
who knew how to attract soldiers of fortune to his service,
and was feared by the whole country.

有寵於晉君
不仕
而居三卿之右
He was a favourite of the prince of Chin and,
although without office,
sat on the right of the Three Ministers.

目所偏視晉國爵之
口所偏肥晉國黜之
Anyone whom he eyed indulgently the state ennobled,
anyone whom he slandered out of prejudice the state degraded.

游其庭者侔於朝
There were as many visitors in his audience chamber
as there were at court.

子華使其俠客以
智鄙相攻
彊弱相凌
Tzǔ-hua allowed
the stronger and cleverer of his men-at-arms
to bully the weaker and sillier;
雖傷破於前不用介意
he took no notice even if someone was wounded in his presence.

終日夜以此為戲樂
國殆成俗
His men amused themselves in this way all day and all night,
until the country was almost used to it.

***

禾生子伯
范氏之上客也
Ho-sheng and Tzǔ-po,
the chief clients of the Fan family,
出行經坰外
宿於田更商丘開之舍
went travelling outside the city,
and lodged in the hut of the old peasant Shang-ch’iu K’ai.

中夜禾生子伯
二人相與言
子華之名勢
In the middle of the night
the two men were talking together
of the fame and power of Tzǔ-hua,
能使
存者亡亡者存
富者貧貧者富
who could save or ruin,
enrich or impoverish,
anyone he pleased.

商丘開先窘
於飢寒
Shang-ch’iu K’ai was a poor man,
always cold and hungry;
潛於牖北聽之
he hid on the North side of the window and listened to them.

因假糧荷畚之子華之門
Encouraged by what he heard, he borrowed provisions,
packed them in a basket on his back,
and travelled to Tzǔ-hua’s gate.

***

子華之門徒
皆世族也
Tzǔ-hua’s retainers,
who were all of noble blood,
縞衣乘軒
緩步闊視
were riding dressed in white silk in carriages with high fronts,
or strolling at their ease staring at the passers-by.

顧見商丘開年老力弱
面目黎黑衣冠不檢
莫不眲之
When they noticed that Shang-ch’iu K’ai was old and feeble,
with a weather-beaten face and unstylish clothes and cap,
they all scorned him.

既而狎侮欺詒
攩㧙挨抌亡所不為
They shoved him, pawed him,
jostled him, slapped him on the back,
and stopped at nothing to insult and make a fool of him.

商丘開常无慍容
而諸客之技單
憊於戲笑
Shang-ch’iu K’ai never showed the least anger,
and when the retainers could think of no more tricks
they tired of the sport.

***

遂與商丘開俱乘高臺
Then they took Shang-ch’iu K’ai up a high terrace.

於眾中漫言曰
Someone in the crowd said as a joke:

***

有能自投下者賞百金
‘A hundred pieces of gold for anyone who can jump down!’

***

眾皆競應
Everyone pretended to take him at his word.

商丘開以為信然
遂先投下
But Shang-ch’iu K’ai thought he was serious
and hastened to jump ahead of the others.

形若飛鳥揚於地
肌骨无毀
His body drifted to the ground like a flying bird,
without breaking flesh or bone.

***

范氏之黨以為偶然
夫詎怪也
Tzǔ-hua’s band thought it was mere luck,
and did not greatly wonder at it.

因復
指河曲之淫隅
曰
But to test him
someone pointed out a deep corner in a bend in the river,
and told him:

***

彼中有寶珠
泳可得也
‘There is a precious pearl down there,
a diver could get it.’

***

商丘開復從而泳之
Shang-ch’iu K’ai proceeded to dive for it;
既出
果得珠焉
and when he came up,
he really had found a pearl.

眾昉同疑
子華昉令豫
肉食衣帛之次
For the first time everyone was doubtful,
and Tzǔ-hua granted him
an allowance of meat and silk with the others.

***

俄而范氏之藏大火
Soon afterwards the Fan storehouse caught fire.

子華曰
若能入火取錦者
從所得多少賞若
‘If you can go into the fire and save my brocades,’
said Tzǔ-hua,
‘I’ll reward you according to the amount you recover.’

***

商丘開往无難色
入火往還
Shang-ch’iu K’ai set off without showing the least reluctance,
went into the fire and returned;
埃不漫
身不焦
the soot did not smear him,
his body was not scorched.

范氏之黨以為有道
乃共謝之曰
Tzǔ-hua’s band were convinced that he possessed the Way,
and they all apologised to him together.

***

吾不知子之有道而誕子
‘We played tricks on you,
not knowing that you possessed the Way;
吾不知子之神人而辱子
we humiliated you,
not knowing that you were a Divine Man.

子其愚我也
子其聾我也
子其盲我也
How stupid,
how deaf,
how blind you must think us!

敢問其道
Permit us to ask you about this Way.’

***

商丘開曰
吾亡道
‘I do not possess the Way,’
said Shang-ch’iu K’ai.

雖吾之心亦不知其所以
‘Even in my own heart I don’t know how I did it.

雖然
有一於此試與子言之
However,
there is one thing I can try to tell you about.

曩子二客之宿吾舍也
聞譽范氏之勢
Not long ago I heard two of you,
who were spending the night in my hut,
praising the fame and power of Tzǔ-hua,
能使
存者亡亡者存
富者貧貧者富
who can save or ruin,
enrich or impoverish,
anyone he pleases.

吾誠之无二心
故不遠而來
I believed you with all my heart,
and that is why I came here,
and the long journey seemed short to me.

及來以子黨之言皆實也
When I arrived, I thought that everything you people said was true;
唯恐
誠之之不至
行之之不及
I feared only that I might fall short in believing and acting on it.

不知
形體之所措
利害之所存也
I forgot where my body was going,
I forgot which things benefit and which things harm me.

心一而已
It is simply that I was single-minded;
物亡迕者如斯而已
that is the only reason why no thing stood in my way.

今昉知
子黨之誕我
But now that I know for the first time
that you were all making fun of me,
我內藏猜慮
外矜觀聽
I have worries and suspicions hidden inside me,
while I put on a brave outward show;
追幸昔日之不焦溺也
怛然內熱
惕然震悸矣
looking back,
I count myself lucky
not to have been drowned or burned.

水火豈復可近哉
Shall I ever dare to go near water and fire again?’

***

自此之後
范氏門徒路遇乞兒馬醫
From this time,
when Tzǔ-hua’s retainers
met a beggar or a horse-doctor on the road,
弗敢辱也
必下車而揖之
they never dared to humiliate him,
and always descended from their carriages and bowed to him.

宰我聞之以告仲尼
Tsai Wo heard of it and told Confucius.

***

仲尼曰
汝弗知乎
‘Didn’t you know?’
said Confucius.

夫至信之人可以感物也
‘The man with perfect faith can make other things react to him.

動天地
感鬼神
橫六合
而无逆者
He moves heaven and earth,
makes the spirits react to him,
fills the universe in every direction
and nothing stands in his way.

豈但
履危險
入水火
而已哉
Do you suppose that all he can do
is tread in perilous places
and walk through fire and water?

商丘開信偽
物猶不逆
況彼我皆誠哉
Things do not stand in the way
even when Shang-ch’iu K’ai trusts a lie,
and how much less when others are as sincere as oneself!

小子識之
Keep it in mind, my disciples.’

周宣王之牧正
有役人梁鴦者
能養野禽獸
The groom of King Hsüan of Chou
had a slave called Liang Yang,
who was skilful in rearing wild beasts and birds.

委食於園庭之內
雖虎狼鵰鶚之類
无不柔馴者
He collected them and fed them in his garden and yard,
and never failed to tame
even creatures as savage as tigers and wolves, eagles and ospreys.

雄雌在前
孳尾成群
Male and female herded together
without fearing to couple and breed in his presence;
異類雜居
不相搏噬也
different species lived side by side
and never pounced and bit each other.

王慮其術終於其身
令毛丘園傳之
The King was concerned that the secrets of his art
should not die with him,
and ordered Mao Ch’iu-yüan to become his apprentice.

***

梁鴦曰
Liang Yang told Mao Ch’iu-yüan:

***

鴦賤役也
何術以告爾
‘I am a vile slave,
what arts have I to teach you?

懼王之謂
隱於爾也
旦一言我養虎之法
But I am afraid His Majesty will say
that I am keeping secrets from you,
so let me say a few words about my method of rearing tigers.

凡
順之則喜
逆之則怒
此有血氣者之性也
Generally speaking,
it is the nature of everything with vigour in its blood
to be pleased when you let it have its way,
and angry when you thwart it.

然喜怒豈妄發哉
But you must not suppose that joy and anger come at random.

皆逆之所犯也
When they are offended,
it is always because we thwart them.

***

夫食虎者
不敢以生物與之
為其殺之之怒也
‘The man who feeds tigers
does not dare to give them a live animal,
because they will get into a rage killing it.

不敢以全物與之
為其碎之之怒也
He does not dare to give them a whole animal,
because they will get into a rage tearing it apart.

時其饑飽
達其怒心
He keeps watch for the times when they are full or hungry,
and penetrates to the motives of their anger.

虎之與人異類
而媚養己者
順也
Although tigers are a different species from man,
when they fawn on the man who rears them
it is because he lets them get their way;
故其殺之者
逆也
and likewise when they kill him
it is because he thwarts them.

***

然
則吾豈敢逆之使怒哉
‘That being so,
how would I dare to make them angry by thwarting them?

亦不順之使喜也
But I do not please them by giving them their way either.

夫喜之復也必怒
怒之復也常喜
皆不中也
For when joy passes its climax we are bound to revert to anger,
and when anger passes its climax we always revert to joy,
because in both cases we are off balance.

今吾心
无逆順者也
則鳥獸之視吾猶其儕也
Now since in my heart
I neither give them their way nor thwart them,
the birds and animals regard me as one of themselves.

故游吾園者
不思高林曠澤
So it is only reasonable that when they roam in my garden,
they do not remember their tall forests and wild marshes,
寢吾庭者
不願深山幽谷
理使然也
and when they sleep in my yard,
they never wish to be deep in the mountains
and hidden away in the valleys.’

顏回問乎仲尼曰
Yen Hui asked Confucius a question:

***

吾嘗濟乎觴深之淵矣
‘Once I crossed the deep lake of Shang-shen;
津人操舟若神
the ferryman handled the boat like a god.

吾問焉曰
操舟可學邪
I asked him
whether one can be taught to handle a boat.

曰可
能游者可教也
“Yes,” he told me,
“anyone who can swim may be taught it;
善游者數能
a good swimmer picks it up quickly;
乃若夫沒人
則未嘗見舟而謖操之者也
as for a diver,
he could handle a boat even if he had never seen one before.”

吾問焉
而不告
I questioned him further,
but that was all he had to say.

敢問何謂也
May I ask what he meant?’

***

仲尼曰
〼[^rse-2-1]
‘Hmm.

吾與若玩其文也久矣
而未達其實
I have been playing with you on the surface for a long time,
but we have never penetrated to the substance;
而固且道與
have you really found the Way?

能游者可教也
輕水也
Anyone who can swim may be taught it,
because he takes water lightly.

善游者之數能也
忘水也
A good swimmer picks it up quickly,
because he forgets the water altogether.

乃若
夫沒人之未嘗見舟也
而謖操之也彼視淵若陵
As for a diver,
he could handle a boat without ever having seen one before,
because to him the depths seem like dry land,
視舟之覆猶其車卻也
and a boat turning over
seems no worse than a cart slipping backwards.

覆卻萬物方
陳乎前
而不得入其舍
Though ten thousand ways of slipping and overturning
spread out before him,
they cannot enter the doors of his mind;
惡往而不暇
he is relaxed wherever he goes.

以瓦摳者巧
Gamble for tiles, and you play skilfully;
以鉤摳者憚
for the clasp of your belt, and you lose confidence;
以黃金摳者惛
for gold, and you get flustered.

其巧一也
You have not lost your skill;
而有所矜
則重外也
but if you hold yourself back,
you give weight to something outside you;
凡重外者拙內
and whoever does that is inwardly clumsy.’

[^rse-2-1]: U+27B92 (⿰言醫) in _Sibu congkan_.

孔子觀於呂梁
Confucius was looking at Lü-liang waterfall.

懸水三十仞
流沫三十里
The water dropped two hundred feet,
streaming foam for thirty miles;
黿鼉魚鱉之所不能游也
見一丈夫游之
it was a place where fish and turtles and crocodiles could not swim,
but he saw a man swimming there.

以為有苦而欲死者也
使弟子並流而承之
Taking him for someone in trouble who wanted to die,
he sent a disciple along the bank to pull him up.

數百步而出
被髮行歌
而游於棠行
But after swimming a few hundred yards the man came out,
and strolled along singing under the bank
with his hair hanging down his back.

孔子從而問之曰
Confucius proceeded to question him:

***

{呂梁懸水三十仞
流沫三十里
黿鼉魚鱉所不能游
向吾見子道之
以為有苦而欲死者
使弟子並流將承子
子出而被髮行歌}

吾以子為鬼也
察子則人也
‘I thought you were a ghost,
but now I can look you over I see you are human.

請問蹈水有道乎
May I ask whether you have a Way to tread in water?’

***

曰亡
吾无道
‘No,
I have no Way.

吾始乎故
長乎性
成乎命
I began in what is native to me,
grew up in what is natural to me,
matured by trusting destiny.

與齎俱入與汩偕出
從水之道而不為私焉
I enter the vortex with the inflow and leave with the outflow,
follow the Way of the water
instead of imposing a course of my own;
此吾所以道之也
this is how I tread it.’

***

孔子曰
何謂
始乎故
長乎性
成乎命也
‘What do you mean by
“beginning in what is native to you,
growing up in what is natural to you,
maturing by trusting destiny”?’

***

曰吾生於陵而安於陵
‘Having been born on land I am safe on land---
故也
this is native to me.

長於水而安於水
Having grown up in the water I am safe in the water---
性也
this is natural to me.

不知吾所以然而然
I do it without knowing how I do it---
命也
this is trusting destiny.’

---

仲尼適楚
Confucius went on a journey to Ch’u.

出於林中
見痀僂者承蜩
猶掇之也
Coming out of a forest,
he saw a man with a crooked back
catching cicadas with a rod and line,
as easily as though he were picking them up off the ground.

***

仲尼曰
子巧乎
‘What skill!’
Confucius said.

有道邪
‘Is it because you have the Way?’

***

曰我有道也
‘I have the Way.

五六月
纍垸二
When the season comes round in the fifth and sixth months,
I balance balls on top of each other.

而不墜
則失者錙銖
If I can balance two without dropping them,
I shall not miss many cicadas;
纍三而不墜
則失者十一
if I can balance three,
I shall miss one in ten;
纍五而不墜
猶掇之也
if I can balance five,
it will be like picking them off the ground.

吾處身也若橛株駒
吾執臂也若槁木之枝
I hold my body like a wood-chopper hacking at a root,
I hold my arm as steady as a branch on a withered tree;
雖天地之大萬物之多
而唯蜩翼之知
out of all the myriad thing in the vastness of heaven and earth,
I am conscious only of the wings of a cicada.

吾不反不側
I never turn about or fidget;
不以萬物易蜩之翼
I would not take the whole world
in exchange for the wings of a cicada.

何為而不得
How can I fail to catch it?’

***

孔子顧謂弟子曰
Confucius turned round and said to his disciples:

> 用志不分
‘“Set your will on one aim,
乃疑於神
And be equal to the gods.”’

其痀僂丈人之謂乎
Doesn’t the saying fit this fellow with a crooked back?’

***

丈人曰
汝逢衣徒也
‘You are one of those people with big sleeves,’[^2-6]
said the man.

亦何知問是乎
‘What do you think you know about it?

脩汝所以而後載言其上
Sweep away those principles of yours before you talk about it again.’

[^2-6]: Confucian dress.

海上之人有好漚鳥者
There was a man living by the sea-shore who loved seagulls.

每旦之海上從漚鳥游
漚鳥之至者百住而不止
Every morning he went down to the sea to roam with the seagulls,
and more birds came to him than you could count in hundreds.

其父曰
His father said to him:

***

吾聞漚鳥皆從汝游
‘I hear the seagulls all come roaming with you.

汝取來吾玩之
Bring me some to play with.’

***

明日
之海上
漚鳥舞而不下也
Next day,
when he went down to the sea,
the seagulls danced above him and would not come down.

***

故曰
Therefore it is said:

至言去言
至為無為
‘The utmost in speech is to be rid of speech,
the utmost doing is Doing Nothing.’

齊智之所知則淺矣
What common knowledge knows is shallow.

趙襄子率徒十萬狩於中山
Chao Hsiang-tzǔ went hunting in the Central Mountains
with a party of a hundred thousand.

藉芿燔林
扇赫百里
He set fire to the forests by lighting the tall grass,
and fanned the flames for a hundred miles.

有一人從石壁中出
隨煙燼上下
A man came out from within a stone cliff,
rising and falling with the smoke and ashes;
眾謂鬼物
the crowd thought he was a demon.

火過
徐行而出
若無所經涉者
When the fire passed,
he came out walking casually,
as though the fire he had passed through did not exist.

襄子怪而留之
Chao Hsiang-tzǔ marvelled and detained the man.

徐而察之
He scrutinised him at leisure;
形色七竅人也
in his shape, his colour, and the seven holes in his head,
he was human;
氣息音聲人也
in his breathing, in his voice,
he was human.

問
奚道而處石
奚道而入火
He asked the man
by what Way he lived in stone and went through fire.

***

其人曰
奚物而謂石
奚物而謂火
‘What are these things you call stone and fire?’
said the man.

***

襄子曰
而嚮之所出者石也
‘The thing you have just come out from was stone.

而嚮之所涉者火也
The thing you have just been walking through was fire.’

***

其人曰
不知也
‘I didn’t know.’

***

魏文侯聞之
問子夏曰
Marquis Wen of Wei heard of it,
and questioned Tzǔ-hsia,
the disciple of Confucius.

***

彼何人哉
‘What sort of man was that?’

***

子夏曰
以商所聞夫子之言
和者大同於物
物無得傷閡者
‘According to what I have heard the Master say,
the man who is in harmony is absolutely the same as other things,
and no thing succeeds in wounding or obstructing him.

游金石
蹈水火
皆可也
To pass through metal and stone
and tread through water and fire
are all possible.’

***

文侯曰
吾子奚不為之
‘Why don’t you do it yourself?’

***

子夏曰
刳心去智
商未之能
‘I am not yet capable of cutting open my heart
and throwing away the knowledge in it.

雖然
試語之有暇矣
However,
I can tell you all you want to know about it.’

***

文侯曰
夫子奚不為之
‘Why doesn’t your Master do it?’

***

子夏曰
夫子
能之
而能不為者也
‘My Master is one who,
though able to do it,
is able not to do it.’

文侯大說
Marquis Wen was delighted with the answer.

有神巫自齊來處於鄭
A shaman with the insight of a god
came from Ch’i to settle in Cheng;
命曰季咸
his name was Chi Hsien.

知人之
死生存亡
禍福壽夭
He knew whether a man
would live or die, survive or perish,
be lucky or unlucky, die young or live out his span.

期以歲月旬日如神
He would predict the date
to the year, the month, the week, the day,
as though he were a god.

鄭人見之
皆避而走
Whenever the people of Cheng saw him,
they all ran to escape him.

列子見之而心醉
而歸以告壺丘子
But when Lieh-tzǔ saw him his heart was drunk,
and he returned to tell his teacher Hu-tzǔ:

***

曰始吾以夫子之道為至矣
則又有至焉者矣
‘Master, once I thought your Way was the utmost,
but there is another which goes still farther.’

***

壺子曰
吾與汝無其文
未既其實
‘I have taught you all that shows on the surface,’
said Hu-tzǔ,
‘but you have not exhausted the substance:
而固得道與
have you really found the Way?

眾雌而无雄
而又奚卵焉
With a crowd of hens and no cock,
can you expect any eggs?

而以道與世抗
必信矣
Trusting in your Way and matching yourself against the world,
you are bound to reach too far.

夫故使人得而相汝
That is how you let the man succeed in reading your face.

嘗試與來
以予示之
Try bringing him here,
and make him take a look at me.’

***

明日列子與之見壺子
Next day, Lieh-tzǔ brought him to see Hu-tzǔ.

出而謂列子曰
Coming out, the shaman told Lieh-tzǔ:

***

譆
‘Alas!

子之先生死矣
Your master is a dead man.

弗活矣
There is no more vitality in him.

不可以旬數矣
He cannot last ten days.

吾見怪焉
I saw a strange thing;
見濕灰焉
I saw damp ash in him.’

***

列子入
涕泣沾衿
以告壺子
Lieh-tzǔ went in,
with the tears soaking the lapels of his coat,
and told Hu-tzǔ.

壺子曰
Hu-tzǔ answered:

***

向吾示之以地文
‘I have just shown him the configuration of my earth.

萌乎
不誫
不止
My breathing,
like the life in a growing shoot,
did not vibrate
yet did not cease.

是殆見吾杜德幾也
He must have seen me as I am
when I check the incipient motions of the virtue within me.

嘗又與來
Try bringing him again.’

***

明日又與之見壺子
Next day, Lieh-tzǔ brought him again to see Hu-tzǔ.

出而謂列子曰
Coming out, the shaman told Lieh-tzǔ:

***

幸矣子之先生遇我也
‘It is lucky that your Master happened to meet me.

有瘳矣
He will recover.

灰然有生矣
There are pale signs of life in him.

吾見其杜權矣
I can see him checking the power in him.’

***

列子入告壺子
壺子曰
When Lieh-tzǔ entered and told him,
Hu-tzǔ said:

***

向吾示之以天壤
‘I have just shown him my soil fertilised by heaven.

名實
不入
Nothing had entered my mind,
either as name or as reality;
而機發於踵
but the incipient breath was coming up from my heels.[^2-7]

此為杜權
This is what made him think I was checking the powers in me.

是殆見吾善者幾也
He must have seen me as I am when the goodness in me is incipient.

嘗又與來
Bring him again.’

***

明日又與之見壺子
Next day he brought him again to see Hu-tzǔ.

出而謂列子曰
Coming out the shaman told Lieh-tzǔ:

***

子之先生坐不齋
吾无得
‘Your Master has not fasted,
so I have nothing to go by.

而相焉
I cannot succeed in reading his face.

試齋
Try when he has fasted.

將且復相之
I will read his face again.’

***

列子入告壺子
壺子曰
When Lieh-tzǔ entered and told him,
Hu-tzǔ said:

***

向吾示之以太沖莫眹
‘I have just shown him the absolute emptiness
in which there is no foreboding of anything.

是殆見吾衡氣幾也
He must have seen me as I am
when I even out the incipient motions of my breath.

Whirlpools, still waters, currents, all hollow out deep pools;
of the nine kinds of deep pool I have shown him three.[^2-8]

嘗又與來
Bring him again.’

***

明日又與之見壺子
Next day he brought him again to see Hu-tzǔ.

立未定自失而走
Before coming to a standstill the shaman fled in a panic.

壺子曰
追之
‘Run after him!’
said Hu-tzǔ.

列子追之而不及
反以報壺子
Lieh-tzǔ ran after him but could not catch up with him,
and returned to inform Hu-tzǔ:

***

曰已滅矣
‘He has vanished.

已失矣
We have lost him.

吾不及也
I could not catch up with him.’

***

壺子曰
向吾示之以未始出吾宗
‘I have just shown him,’
said Hu-tzǔ,
‘myself before we first came out of our Ancestor.

> 吾與之虛
而猗移
With him I dissolved,
and drifted winding in and out of things,
不知其誰何
Unknowing who and what we were.
因以為弟靡
To him,
it seemed we had floundered,
因以為波隨
It seemed that the waves had swept us away.

故逃也
That is why he fled.’

***

然後列子自以為未始學
Only then did Lieh-tzǔ understand
that he had never learned anything;
而歸
三年不出
he went home,
and for three years did not leave his house.

> 為其妻爨
He cooked meals for his wife,
食狶如食人
Served food to his pigs as though they were human,
於事无親
Treated all things as equally his kin.
雕瑑復朴
From the carved jade he returned to the unhewn block,
塊然
獨以其形立
Till his single shape stood forth,
detached from all things.
㤋然而封戎
He was free of all tangles
壹
以是終
Once and for all,
to the end of his life.

[^2-7]: Cf. _Chuang-tzǔ_,
‘The True Men of old did not dream when they slept
and had no cares when they woke,
ate without tasting and breathed deeply.
The True Man breathes from his heels,
the common man breathes from his throat.’
In Chinese cosmology breath (_ch’i_)
is the basic substance of the universe;
the purer breath rises and becomes heaven,
the impure breath falls,
condenses and becomes earth (cf. 14 above).
A man’s breath is the energy which keeps him in motion
and out of which his body has condensed;
and control of his breathing (as in Indian Yoga)
is an essential means of returning to the cosmic ground
out of which he has emerged.

[^2-8]: I here follow the text of the _Chuang-tzǔ_,
from which the story of the shaman Chi Hsien is taken.
(It is, by the way,
full of rare words and textual corruption,
so that the translation is often speculative.)
The editor of the Lieh-tzǔ has obscured the point
by introducing the full list of the nine pools:

    鯢旋之潘為淵
‘Whirlpools,
止水之潘為淵
still waters,
流水之潘為淵
currents,
濫水之潘為淵
water bubbling up from the ground,
沃水之潘為淵
water dripping from above,
氿水之潘為淵
water slanting from a cave in the side,
雍水之潘為淵
water dammed and turned back to its source,
汧水之潘為淵
water which drains away in a marsh,
肥水之潘為淵
several streams from one source,
all hollow out deep pools.
是為九淵焉
These are the nine kinds of deep pool.’

---

子列子之齊
中道而反
Lieh-tzǔ was going to Ch’i,
but turned back halfway.

遇伯昏瞀人
伯昏瞀人曰奚方而反
On the road he met Po-hun Wu-jen,
who asked him why he had turned back.

***

曰吾驚焉
‘I was alarmed by something.’

***

惡乎驚
‘What was it?’

***

曰吾食於十漿
而五漿先饋
‘I ate at ten inns,
and at five they served me first.’

***

伯昏瞀人曰
若是
則汝何為驚己
‘If that is all,
why should you be alarmed?’

***

曰夫內誠不解
形諜成光
以外鎮人心
‘When a man’s inner integrity is not firm,
something oozes from his body and becomes an aura,
which outside him presses on the hearts of others;
使人輕乎貴老
而〼[^rse-2-2]其所患
it makes other men honour him more than his elders and betters,
and gets him into difficulties.

***

夫漿人特為
食羹之貨
多餘之贏
‘The only motive of an innkeeper
is to sell his rice and soup,
and increase his earnings;
其為利也薄
其為權也輕
his profits are meagre,
the considerations which sway him have little weight.

而猶若是
If men with so little to gain from me
value me so highly as a customer,
而況於萬乘之主乎
身勞於國
而智盡於事
will it not be even worse with the lord of ten thousand chariots,
who has worn out his body
and drained his knowledge in state affairs?

彼將任我以事
而效我以功
The prince of Ch’i will appoint me to some office,
and insist that I fill it efficiently.

吾是以驚
This is what alarmed me.’

***

伯昏瞀人曰
善哉觀乎
‘An excellent way to look at it!

汝處己
人將保汝矣
But even if you stay,
other men will lay responsibilities on you.’

***

无幾
何而往
則戶外之屨滿矣
Not long afterwards,
when Po-hun Wu-jen went to call on him,
Lieh-tzǔ’s porch was full of the shoes of visitors.

伯昏瞀人北面
Po-hun Wu-jen stood facing North[^2-9];
而立敦杖蹙之乎頤
he leaned on his upright staff and wrinkled his cheek against it.

立有閒
不言而出
After standing there for a while,
he left without speaking.

賓者以告列子
The doorkeeper told Lieh-tzǔ.

列子提履徒跣而走
暨乎門
Lieh-tzǔ ran out barefoot holding his shoes in his hand,
and caught up with him at the gate.

***

問曰
先生既來
曾不廢藥乎
‘Now that you have come, Master,’
he said,
‘aren’t you even going to give me my medicine?’

***

曰已矣
‘Enough!

吾固告汝曰
人將保汝
果保汝矣
I told you confidently
that others would lay responsibilities on you,
and it turns out that so they have.

非汝能使人保汝
It is not that you are capable of allowing them to do so;
而汝不能使人无汝保也
you are incapable of preventing them.

而焉用之感也
感豫出異
What use is it to you to have this effect on people,
which is incompatible with your own peace?

且必有感也
搖而本身
又无謂也
If you insist on making an effect,
it will unsteady your basic self,
and to no purpose.

> 與汝遊者又莫汝告也
None of your companions will tell you.
彼所小言盡人毒也
All their small talk is poison.
莫覺莫悟
何相孰也
Unless we wake each other,
how shall we mature?’

楊朱南之沛
Yang Chu travelled South to P’ei.

老聃西遊於秦
邀於郊
至梁而遇老子
When Lao-tzǔ was wandering Westward towards Ch’in,
Yang Chu went outside the town to intercept him,
and came on him as he reached Liang.

老子中道仰天而歎曰
Lao-tzǔ stood in the middle of the road
with his eyes raised to heaven and sighed:

***

始以汝為可教
今不可教也
‘Once I thought you were teachable,
but I see you are not.’

***

楊子不荅
Yang Chu did not answer.

至舍
進涫漱
巾櫛
When they came to his inn,
he presented Lao-tzǔ with towel and comb,
and water to wash his hands and rinse his mouth.

脫履戶外
膝行而前曰
Leaving his shoes outside the door,
he crawled on his knees into Lao-tzǔ’s presence and said:

***

向者夫子仰天而歎曰
始以汝為可教
今不可教
‘Master, just now you looked up at heaven and sighed
“Once I thought you were teachable,
but I see you are not.”

弟子欲請夫子辭
行不閒
是以不敢
Your disciple wished to ask you for an explanation,
but you walked on without giving me an opportunity,
so I did not dare.

今夫子閒矣
請問其過
Now that you have the time,
I should like to ask what I have done wrong.’

***

老子曰
Lao-tzǔ answered:

> 而睢睢
而盱盱
‘How haughtily you glare!
而誰與居
Who can live with you?
大白若辱
The purest white is as though smirched.
盛德若不足
The fullest virtue seems less than enough.’

***

楊朱蹴然變容曰
Yang Chu’s face furrowed as he said:

> 敬聞命矣
‘With reverence I hear your command.’

***

其往也
舍迎將家
At the time when Yang Chu went on his journey,
the innkeepers would welcome him and see him off;
公執席
妻執巾櫛
the landlord himself would bring his mat,
the landlord’s wife would bring his towel and comb;
舍者避席煬者避竈
the lodgers would resign him a mat or a place by the stove.

其反也
舍者與之爭席矣
At the time when he returned,
other lodgers would jostle with him for a mat.

---

楊朱過宋
東之於逆旅
When Yang Chu was passing through Sung,
he spent the night at an inn.

逆旅人有妾二人
其一人美
其一人惡
The innkeeper had two concubines,
one beautiful
and the other ugly.

惡者貴
而美者賤
The ugly one he valued,
the beautiful one he neglected.

楊子問其故
逆旅小子對曰
When Yang Chu asked the reason,
the fellow answered:

***

其美者自美
吾不知其美也
‘The beautiful one thinks herself beautiful,
and I do not notice her beauty.

其惡者自惡
吾不知其惡也
The ugly one thinks herself ugly,
and I do not notice her ugliness.’

***

楊子曰
弟子記之
‘Remember this, my disciples,’
said Yang Chu.

行賢而去自賢之行
安往而不愛哉
‘If you act nobly and banish from your mind
the thought that you are noble,
where can you go and not be loved?’

---

天下
有常勝之道
有不常勝之道
In the world
there is a Way by which one will always conquer
and there is a way by which one will never conquer.

常勝之道曰柔
常不勝之道曰彊
The former is called Weakness,
the latter is called Strength.

二者亦知
而人未之知
The two are easy to recognise,
but still men do not recognise them.

故上古之言
Hence the saying of the men of the most ancient times:

彊先不己若者
柔先出於己者
‘The strong surpass those weaker than themselves,
the weak surpass those stronger than themselves.’

先不己若者至於若己則殆矣
先出於己者亡所殆矣
The man who surpasses men weaker than himself
is in danger when he meets someone as strong as himself,
but the man who surpasses men stronger than himself
is never in danger.

以此勝一身若徒
以此任天下若徒
The saying
‘By this you conquer your own body and make it your servant,
by this you employ the whole world as your servant’
謂不勝而自勝
不任而自任也
means that you conquer not others but yourself,
employ not others but yourself.

***

粥子曰
Yü Hsiung said:

> 欲剛
必以柔守之
‘If your aim is to be hard,
you must guard it by being soft.
欲彊
必以弱保之
If your aim is to be strong,
you must maintain it by being weak.
積於柔必剛
What begins soft and accumulates must become hard.
積於弱必彊
What begins weak and accumulates must become strong.
觀其所積
以知禍福之鄉
Watch them accumulate,
and you will know where blessing and disaster come from.
彊勝不若己者
至於若己者剛
The strong conquer those weaker than themselves,
and when they meet an equal have no advantage.
柔勝出於己者
其力不可量
The weak conquer those stronger than themselves,
their force is immeasurable.’

***

老聃曰
Lao-tzǔ said:

> 兵彊則滅
‘If a weapon is strong it will perish,
木彊則折
If a tree is strong it will snap.
柔弱者生之徒
Softness and weakness belong to life,
堅彊者化之徒
Hardness and strength belong to death.’[^2-10]

[^2-10]: Cf. _Tao-te-ching_, ch. 76.
That the sage wins by being softer, weaker, more yielding,
is one of the main themes of the _Tao-te-ching_,
but it is not prominent in the _Lieh-tzǔ_.

狀不必童而智童
智不必童而狀童
A thing may be as wise as a man
without necessarily looking like a man,
or look like a man
without necessarily being as wise as a man.

聖人取童智而遺童狀
眾人近童狀而䟽童智
The sage prefers those who share his wisdom,
but the ordinary man feels closer to those who look like himself,
狀與我童者近而愛之
狀與我異者䟽而畏之
loving as his kin things which look as he does,
and shunning as alien things which look different.

有七尺之骸
手足之異
戴髮含齒
倚而趣者
謂之人
Anything with a skeleton six feet high,
hands different from its feet,
hair on its head and front teeth hidden inside its mouth,
which leans forward as it runs,
is called a ‘man’;
而人未必无獸心
yet a man may well have the mind of a beast.

雖有獸心
以狀而見親矣
But even if he does,
he will be accepted as one of us because he looks like us.

傅翼戴角
分牙布爪
仰飛伏走
謂之禽獸
Anything with wings at its sides or horns on its head,
with teeth and nails wide apart,
which flies up into the air or walks on all fours,
is called a ‘beast’ or a ‘bird’;
而禽獸未必无人心
yet a beast or bird may well have the mind of a man.

雖有人心
以狀而見䟽矣
But even if it does,
it will be treated as alien because it looks different.

庖犧氏
女媧氏
Fu-hsi,
Nü-kua,
神農氏
夏后氏
Shen-nung,
and the Emperors of the Hsia dynasty,
蛇身
人面
had snakes’ bodies,
human faces,
牛首
虎鼻
heads of oxen
and tigers’ snouts.

此有非人之狀
而有大聖之德
They did not look like men,
but they had the virtue of great sages.

夏桀
殷紂
The Emperors Chieh of the Hsia
and Chou of the Yin dynasties,
魯桓
楚穆
Duke Huan of Lu
and King Mu of Ch’u,
狀貌七竅皆同於人
而有禽獸之心
all shared with other men
the same looks and the same seven holes in their heads,
but they had the minds of beasts.

而眾人守一狀以求至智
未可幾也
The ordinary man who insists on seeking the utmost wisdom
only among those with one kind of looks
is not likely to find it.

黃帝與炎帝戰於阪泉之野
帥熊羆狼豹貙虎為前驅
以鵰鶡鷹鳶為旗幟
When the Yellow Emperor made war against Yen-ti
in the wilds of Fan-ch’üan,
he commanded bears, wolves, leopards and tigers as his vanguard,
and eagles, pheasants, falcons and kites as his standard-bearers.

此以力使禽獸者也
This is an example of mastering the beasts and birds by force.

堯使夔典樂
擊石拊石百獸率舞
When Yao made K’uei his director of music,
he beat the stone chimes and all the beasts joined in the dance;
簫韶九成
鳳皇來儀
he performed the nine parts of the Hsiao-shao music,
and the phoenix came to dance to its rhythm.

此以聲致禽獸者也
This is an example of attracting the beasts and birds by music.

然則禽獸之心奚為異人
In what way, then,
are the minds of beasts and birds different from man’s?

形音與人異
而不知接之之道焉
Since they differ from men in shape and voice,
we do not know the Way to make contact with them,
聖人无所不知无所不通
故得引而使之焉
but the sage knows everything and understands everything,
and that is why he succeeds in drawing them to him
and making them his servants.

***

禽獸之智有自然與人童者
There are ways in which the intelligence of beasts and birds
is by nature similar to man’s.

其齊欲攝生
亦不假智於人也
They wish as much as we do to preserve their lives,
and do not have to borrow from man’s wisdom to do so.

牝牡相偶
母子相親
Buck and doe mate together,
mother and child keep close together;
避平依險
違寒就溫
they shun the plains and choose inaccessible places,
avoid cold and seek out warmth;
居則有群
行則有列
they live in herds
and travel in formations
小者居內
壯者居外
with the young ones on the inside
and the fully grown on the outside;
飲則相攜
食則鳴群
they lead each other to water
and call to each other when they find food.

太古之時則
與人同處
與人並行
In the most ancient times
men and animals lived together
and walked side by side.

帝王之時
始驚駭散亂矣
In the time of the Five Emperors and the Three Kings,
the animals were frightened away and scattered for the first time.

逮於末世
隱伏逃竄以避患害
In our own degenerate times,
they crouch in hiding and flee to their lairs to avoid harm.

***

今東方介氏之國
其國人數數解六畜之語者
Even now, in the country of Chieh in the East,
there are many people who understand
the speech of domestic animals;
蓋偏知之所得
this is a discovery possible even to our own limited knowledge.

太古神聖之人
備知萬物情態
悉解異類音聲
The divine sages of the most ancient times
knew the habits of all the myriad things,
and interpreted the cries of all the different species;
會而聚之
訓而受之
同於人民
they called them together for meetings
and gave them instructions,
as though they were human beings.

故先會鬼神魑魅
次達八方人民
末聚禽獸蟲蛾
So the fact that the sages would meet the spirits and goblins first,
next summon the human beings of the eight quarters,
and finally assemble the birds and beasts and insects,
言血氣之類心智不殊遠也
implies that there are no great differences
in mind and intelligence between living species.

神聖知其如此
故其所教訓者无所遺逸焉
The divine sages knew that this was the case,
and therefore in teaching they left out none of them.

宋有狙公者愛狙養之成群
There was a keeper of monkeys in Sung
who loved monkeys so much that he reared flocks of them.

能解狙之意
狙亦得公之心
He could interpret the monkey’s thoughts,
and the monkeys too caught what was in his mind.

損其家口充狙之欲
He made his own family go short
in order to give the monkeys whatever they wanted.

俄而匱焉
將限其食
Before long he found himself in need,
and decided to give them less to eat.

恐眾狙之不馴於己也
先誑之曰
Fearing that the monkeys would not submit to it tamely,
he played a trick on them beforehand:

***

與若茅朝三而暮四
足乎
‘If I give you three chestnuts in the morning and four in the evening,
will that be enough?’

***

眾狙皆起而怒
The monkeys all got up in a rage.

***

俄而曰
與若茅朝四而暮三
足乎
‘Will it be enough
if I give you four in the morning and three in the evening?’

***

眾狙皆伏而喜
The monkeys were all pleased and lay down again.

***

物之以能鄙相籠皆猶此也
It is always the same
when the cleverer of two things traps the sillier.

聖人以智籠群愚
亦猶狙公之以智籠眾狙也
The sage by his wisdom gets all the fools into his cage,
just as the keeper did to the monkeys.

名實
不虧
使其喜怒哉
Without taking anything away,
in name or reality,
he can either please them or enrage them!

已无變矣
Even when a cock crows at them,
it no longer affects them.

望之似木鷄矣
From a distance they look like cocks carved in wood.

其德全矣
Their virtue is complete.

異鷄无敢應者
Another cock never dares to answer them;
反走耳
it simply turns and runs.’

惠盎見宋康王
Hui Ang visited King K’ang of Sung.

康王蹀足
謦欬
疾言曰
The King stamped his foot,
coughed,
and said fiercely:

***

寡人之所說者勇有力也
‘What pleases me is courage and strength;
不說為仁義者也
I take no pleasure in men who preach morality.

客將何以教寡人
What have you to teach me?’

***

惠盎對曰
臣有道於此使人
雖勇刺之不入
雖有力擊之弗中
‘Suppose that I have a Way to make anyone,
however brave and strong,
miss when he stabs or strikes at you;
大王獨无意邪
wouldn’t Your Majesty be interested?’

***

宋王曰善
‘Excellent.

此寡人之所欲聞也
This is the sort of thing I like to hear.’

***

惠盎曰
夫刺之不入
擊之不中
此猶辱也
‘But even if his stab or blow misses,
it is still humiliating for you.

臣有道於此使人
雖有勇弗敢刺
雖有力弗敢擊
Suppose that I have a Way to prevent anyone,
however brave and strong,
from daring to stab or strike you.

夫弗敢非无其志也
But a man who does not dare to harm you
may still have the will to harm you.

臣有道於此使人
本无其志也
Suppose that I have a Way to ensure that men
have absolutely no will to harm you.

夫无其志也
未有愛利之心也
But a man who has no will to harm you
may still have no thought of loving or benefiting you.

臣有道於此使天下丈夫女子
莫不驩然皆欲愛利之
Suppose that I have a Way to make
every single man and woman in the world
joyfully desire to love and benefit you.

此其賢於勇有力也四累之上也
This is three degrees better than courage and strength.

大王獨无意邪
Isn’t Your Majesty interested?’

***

宋王曰
此寡人之所欲得也
‘This is the sort of Way I should like to find.’

***

惠盎對曰孔墨是已
‘The teaching of Confucius and Mo-tzǔ is what I have in mind.[^2-11]

孔丘墨翟
无地而為君
無官而為長
Confucius and Mo-tzǔ
became princes without owning territory,
became leaders without holding office.

天下丈夫女子莫不延頸舉踵而願安利之
Every man and woman in the world
craned his neck and stood on tiptoe
in his eagerness for their safety and benefit.

今大王萬乘之主也
Now Your Majesty is the lord of ten thousand chariots.

誠有其志
則四境之內皆得其利矣
If you were indeed to share the aims of these two men,
everyone within your four borders would enjoy the benefit.

其賢於孔墨也遠矣
You would be far greater than Confucius and Mo-tzǔ.’

***

宋王無以應
The King was at a loss for an answer.

惠盎趨而出
Hui Ang hurried out;
宋王謂左右曰
and the King said to his courtiers:

辯矣
客之以說服寡人也
‘Clever,
the way he talked me round with his argument!’

[^2-11]: The schools of Confucius (551-479 B.C.)
and of Mo-tzǔ (c. 400 B.C.),
the teacher of universal love,
were bitter enemies,
but since both were moralistic
they were often classed together in contrast to other schools.
