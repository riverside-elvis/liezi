## 說符 Explaining Conjunctions

子列子
學於壺丘子林
Lieh-tzǔ
was studying under Hu-tzǔ.

***

壺丘子林曰
子知持後
則可言持身矣
‘When you know how to keep to the rear,’
Hu-tzǔ told him,
‘I can start teaching you how to behave.’

***

列子曰
願聞持後
‘Please tell me about keeping to the rear.’

***

曰
顧若影
則知之
‘Look round at your shadow,
and you will understand.’

***

列子顧
而觀影
Lieh-tzǔ looked round
and watched his shadow.

形枉則影曲
When his figure bent
his shadow was crooked,
形直則影正
when his figure stood upright
his shadow was straight.

***

然則
枉直
隨形
而不在影
So
whether to bend or stand upright
rests with the figure
and not with the shadow;
屈申
任物
而不在我
and whether we should be active or passive
depends on other things
and not on ourselves.

此之謂
持後而處先
This is what is meant by
‘staying at the front by keeping to the rear’.

關尹
謂子列子曰
Kuan-yin
said to Lieh-tzǔ:

***

言美則響美
言惡則響惡
‘If your words are beautiful
or ugly,
so is their echo;
身長則影長
身短則影短
if your person is tall
or short,
so is its shadow.

名也者響也
行也者影也
Reputation is the echo,
conduct is the shadow.

故曰
Hence it is said:

> 慎爾言
“Be careful of your words,
將有和之
For someone will agree with them.
慎爾行
Be careful of your conduct,
將有隨之
For someone will imitate it.”’

---

是故聖人
見出
以知入
. . .[^8-1] Therefore the sage
knows what will go in
by seeing what came out,
觀往
以知來
knows what is coming
by observing what has passed.

此其所以先知之理也
This is the principle by which he knows in advance.

***

度在身
稽在人
We judge by our own experience,
verify by the experience of others.

人愛我
我必愛之
If a man loves me
I am sure to love him;
人惡我
我必惡之
if he hates me
I am sure to hate him.

湯武
愛天下
故王
Similarly
T’ang and Wu
became Emperors
because they loved the Empire,
桀紂
惡天下
故亡
Chieh and Chou
were ruined
because they hated the Empire;
此所稽也
this is the verification.

稽度皆明
而不道也
When judgement and verification are both plain,
refusing to act on them
譬之出不由門
行不從徑也
is like refusing to go by the door when you leave
or follow the path when you walk.

以是
求利
不亦難乎
If you do this,
will it not be difficult
to get the benefit you seek?

***

嘗觀之
神農
有炎
之德
I have observed this
in the virtue of
Shen-nung
and Yu-yen,
稽之
虞夏
商周
之書
verified it
in the books of
Shun and the Hsia,
Shang and Chou dynasties,
度諸
法士
賢人
之言
judged it
by the sayings
of exemplary scholars
and worthy men;

所以
存亡
廢興
而非由此道者
未之有也
and I have never found
a case where
survival or ruin,
rise or decline
did not derive from this principle.

[^8-1]: What follows is evidently a fragment,
of which the introduction is lost.
It does not seem to be Taoist;
the claim that the rise and fall of dynasties
depends on winning and losing the love of the people,
as well as several incidental features,
strongly suggest the school of Mo-tzǔ.

嚴恢曰
Yen Hui said
to Lieh-tzǔ:[^8-2]

***

所為問道者
為富
‘The reason for inquiring about the Way
is to get rich.

今得珠亦富矣
安用道
I might get rich by finding a pearl,
and then why should I need the Way?’

***

子列子曰
桀紂
唯重利
而輕道
‘Chieh and Chou
gave weight to nothing but their own interests
and neglected the Way;
是以亡
that is why they perished.

幸哉余未汝語也
How lucky that I have the chance to tell you in time!

> 人
而无義
“Men,
yet devoid of honour,
唯食
而已
Living for food
and nothing else,”

是雞狗也
---such are no better than chickens and dogs.

> 彊食靡角
“They lock their horns fighting for food,
勝者為制
And the victor makes the rules,”

是禽獸也
---such are no better than the wild beasts and birds.

為雞狗
禽獸矣
而欲人之尊己
不可得也
If you are as lazy as a chicken or dog,
or as savage as a wild beast or bird,
you cannot expect
other men to respect you.

人不尊己
則危辱及之矣
If others do not respect you,
danger and disgrace will befall you.’

[^8-2]: This is not Yen Hui the disciple of Confucius,
whose name is written differently in Chinese.

---

列子學射
中矣
Lieh-tzǔ was studying archery,
and hit the target.

請於關尹子
關尹子曰
He sought advice from Kuan-yin,
who asked him:

***

子知子之所以中者乎
‘Do you know why you hit the target?’

***

對曰
弗知也
‘No.’

***

關尹子曰
未可
‘It won’t do yet.’

***

退而習之
三年
又以報關尹子
He went away to practice,
and after three years
again reported to Kuan-yin.

***

關尹子曰
子知子之所以中者乎
‘Do you know why you hit the target?’

***

列子曰
知之矣
‘I know.’

***

關尹子曰
可矣
‘It will do.

守而勿失也
Hold on to this knowledge and do not lose it.’

***

非獨射也
為國與身
亦皆如之
This applies,
not only to archery,
but to ruling the state and ruling oneself.

故聖人
不察存亡
而察其所以然
Therefore the sage
scrutinises,
not the fact of survival or ruin,
but its reasons.[^8-3]

[^8-3]: This is obviously not a Taoist story.
It comes from the chapter _Shen chi’_ (‘Self-examination’)
in the _Lü-shih ch’un-ch’iu_,
a collection representing several philosophical schools (c. 240 B.C.).
There it illustrates a principle directly opposed to Taoism:
‘Whatever is so of a thing must have reasons;
if you do not know the reasons,
even if you succeed as well as one who does know,
you will certainly end by getting into difficulties.’

---

列子曰
Lieh-tzǔ said:

***

色盛者驕
力盛者奮
‘Those in the prime of their beauty are proud,
those in the prime of their strength are impetuous;
未可以語道也
you cannot talk to them about the Way.

故不班白
語道矣
而況行之乎
People with no white streaks in their hair
go wrong when they talk about the Way,
still more when they try to walk it.

故自奮
則人莫之告
If a man is proud and impetuous
no one tells him things,
人莫之告
則孤而無輔矣
and if no one tells him things
he is alone with no one to keep him steady.

***

賢者任人
故年老
而不衰
‘The clever man gives responsibility to others,
and therefore his power does not diminish
when he grows old,
智盡
而不亂
and he is not thrown into confusion
when his knowledge runs out.

故治國之難
在於知賢
而不在自賢
Therefore the difficulty in ruling a state
lies in recognising cleverness,
not in being clever oneself.’

---

宋人有
為其君
以玉為楮葉者
There was a man of Sung
who made a mulberry leaf out of jade
to give to his prince.

三年而成
It took him three years to finish;
鋒殺
莖柯
毫芒
繁澤
亂之楮葉之中
而不可別也
and when it was mixed up with real mulberry leaves,
its indentations,
stalk,
veins
and lustre
were indistinguishable from those of the rest.

此人遂以巧
食宋國
So the man’s skill
won him a regular salary from the government of Sung.

子列子聞之
曰
When Lieh-tzǔ heard of it,
he said:

***

使天地之生物
三年而成一葉
則物之有葉者寡矣
‘If heaven and earth grew things so slowly
that it took them three years to finish a leaf,
there would not be many things with leaves.’

***

故聖人
恃道化
而不恃智巧
Therefore the sage
trusts the transforming process of the Way,
and puts no trust in cunning and skill.

---

子列子窮
容貌有飢色
Lieh-tzǔ was in need,
and his face had a starved look.

客有言之於鄭子陽者曰
A visitor mentioned him to Tzǔ-yang,
the chief minister of Cheng:

***

列禦寇蓋
有道之士也
‘Lieh-tzǔ is known to be
a man who possesses the Way.

居君之國而窮
君无乃為不好士乎
If he is in need while living in your state,
may it not be thought that you are not a generous patron?’

***

鄭子陽即令官
遺之粟
Tzǔ-yang immediately ordered the department concerned
to send him a present of grain.

子列子出見使者
再拜
而辭
Lieh-tzǔ went outside to see the messenger,
bowed twice,
and refused the gift.

使者去
子列子入
After the messenger left
and Lieh-tzǔ came in,
其妻望之
而拊心
曰
his wife glared at him
and beat her breast,
saying:

***

妾聞
為有道者之妻子
皆得佚樂
‘I have heard
that the wives and children of men who possess the Way
all live comfortably and happily.

今
有饑色
君過而遺先生食
先生不受
But now,
when starvation shows in our faces,
and the Duke hears of you and sends you food,
you refuse the gift.

豈不命也哉
We must be destined to misery!’

***

子列子笑謂之曰
君非自知我也
‘It is not that the Duke knows me personally,’
answered Lieh-tzǔ smiling.

以人之言
而遺我粟
‘He sent me grain
because of what another man said.

至其罪我也
又且以人之言
If he should ever condemn me,
it will also be on the word of another man.[^8-4]

此吾所以不受也
This is why I did not accept.’

***

其卒
民果作難
而殺子陽
In the end
it did happen that the people made trouble
and killed Tzǔ-yang.

[^8-4]: Lieh-tzǔ is afraid of being involved with Tzǔ-yang
when he falls from favour.
Like the stories which follow,
this illustrates the importance of adapting oneself
to the particular situation,
and not sticking to unvarying principles.

魯施氏
有二子
Mr Shih of Lu
had two sons;
其一好學
其一好兵
one loved learning,
the other loved war.

好學者
以術干齊侯
The former
presented himself as a teacher to the Marquis of Ch’i,
齊侯納之
以為諸公子之傅
who admitted him to the court
as tutor to his sons.

好兵者之楚
以法干楚王
The latter went to Ch’u,
and presented himself as a strategist to the King,
楚王悅之
以為軍正
who was pleased with him
and put him in command of the army.

祿富其家
爵榮其親
The two men’s salaries enriched the family
and their rank brought honour to their parents.

***

施氏之鄰人孟氏
同有二子
Mr Shih’s neighbour Mr Meng
also had two sons,
所業亦同
而窘於貧
trained in the same two professions,
but he was miserably poor.

羨施氏之有
因從請
進趣之方
Envying the wealth of Mr Shih,
he asked him
by what method his family had risen in the world so fast;
二子以實告孟氏
and Mr Shih’s two sons told him what they had done.

***

孟氏之一子之秦
以術干秦王
Then one of Mr Meng’s sons went to Ch’in,
and presented himself as a teacher to the King of Ch’in.

秦王曰
The King said:

***

當今諸侯力爭
所務兵食而已
‘At present the princes of the states are in violent contention,
and are occupied solely with arming and feeding their troops.

若用仁義治吾國
是滅亡之道
If I rule my state in accordance with moral teaching,
this will be the Way to ruin and extinction.’

***

遂宮
而放之
So he castrated the man
and banished him.

***

其一子之衛
以法干衛侯
The other son went to Wei,
and presented himself as a strategist to the Marquis of Wei.

衛侯曰
The Marquis said:

***

吾弱國也
而攝乎大國之間
‘Mine is a weak state,
situated between big states.

大國吾事之
小國吾撫之
Bigger states I serve,
smaller states I protect;
是求安之道
this is the Way to seek safety.

若賴兵權
滅亡可待矣
If I rely on military force,
ruin and extinction will be a question of hours.

若全而歸之
適於他國
為吾之患不輕矣
But if I let this man leave unharmed,
he will go to another state
and cause me serious trouble.’

***

遂刖之
而還諸魯
So he cut off the man’s feet
and sent him back to Lu.

***

既反
孟氏之父子叩胸
而讓施氏
After their return,
Mr Meng and his two sons beat their breasts
and cursed Mr Shih.

施氏曰

> 凡得時者昌
‘Pick the right time and flourish,
失時者亡
Miss the right time and perish,’

answered Mr Shih.

子道與吾同
而功與吾異
‘Your Way was the same as ours,
yet you failed where we succeeded---
失時者也
非行之謬也
not because you did the wrong things,
but because you picked the wrong time to do them.

且天下
理无常是
事无常非
In any case,
nowhere is there a principle which is right in all circumstances,
or an action that is wrong in all circumstances.

先日所用
今或棄之
今之所棄
後或用之
The method we used yesterday
we may discard today
and use again in the future;
此用與不用
无定是非也
there are no fixed right and wrong
to decide whether we use it or not.

投隙
抵時
The capacity to pick times
and snatch opportunities,
應事无方
屬乎智
and be never at a loss how to answer events,
belongs to the wise.

智苟不足
使若博如孔丘
If you are not wise enough,
even if you are as learned as Confucius
術如呂尚
焉往而不窮哉
or as great a strategist as Lü Shang,[^8-5]
you will get in trouble wherever you go.’

***

孟氏父子舍然
无慍容
Mr Meng and his sons were satisfied
and showed no more ill will.

曰
吾知之矣
‘We understand,’
they said.

子勿重言
‘You need say no more.’

[^8-5]: Lü Shang (T’ai-kung),
enfiefed as first Duke of Ch’i (cf. p. 133)
by King Wu of Chou (1156-1116 B.C.).
He is the supposed author of the military classic _Liu-t’ao_.

---

晉文公出
會欲伐衛
Duke Wen of Chin set out to meet his allies,
intending to attack Wei.

公子鋤仰天而笑
Kung-tzǔ Ch’u looked up at the sky smiling.

公問何笑
The Duke asked why he smiled.

***

曰臣笑鄰之人
有送其妻適私家者
‘I am smiling at a neighbour of mine,
who was escorting his wife on a visit to her family.

道見桑婦
悅而與之言
He saw a woman at the roadside working on the mulberries,
found her attractive and spoke to her.

然顧視其妻
亦有招之者矣
But when he looked round at his wife,
there was another man beckoning to her.

臣竊笑此也
I take the liberty of smiling at this.’

***

公寤其言
乃止
The Duke saw the point,
and halted.

引師而還
未至
而有伐其北鄙者矣
He returned with his army,
but before he arrived
another state had attacked his North borders.

---

晉國苦盜
The state of Chin was infested with robbers.

有郄雍者
能視盜之貌
There was a certain Hsi Yung
who could read a man’s face,
察其眉睫之閒
而得其情
and recognise him as a robber
by scrutinising the space between his eyebrows and eyelashes.

晉侯使視盜
The Marquis of Chin sent him to identify robbers;
千百无遺一焉
he did not miss one in a hundred or a thousand.

晉侯大喜
告趙文子曰
The Marquis was delighted
and told Chao Wen-tzǔ:

***

吾得一人
而一國盜為之盡矣
‘By discovering this one man
I have made an end of robbery throughout the country.

奚用多為
Why should we need anyone else?’

***

文子曰
吾君恃伺察而得盜
盜不盡矣
‘My lord will never get rid of robbers
if he relies on an inspector to catch them.

且郄雍
必不得其死焉
I would add that Hsi Yung
certainly will not die a natural death.’

***

俄
而群盜謀
曰
Immediately afterwards
the robber bands plotted together,
saying:

吾所以窮者郄雍也
‘The man who has brought us to this pass is Hsi Yung.’

遂共盜
而殘之
Then they joined forces to waylay him,
and murdered him.

晉侯聞而大駭
立召文子而告之曰
The Marquis of Chin was very startled at the news,
and at once called Wen-tzǔ:

***

果如子言
郄雍死矣
‘It has turned out as you said,
Hsi Yung is dead.

然取盜何方
But how are we going to catch the robbers?’

***

文子曰
周諺有言
‘There is a proverb of Chou:

> 察見淵魚者不祥
“Scrutiny which reveals the fish in a pool is unlucky.
智料隱匿者有殃
The wisdom which guesses secrets is fatal.”

***

且君欲无盜
若莫舉賢而任之
‘If you wish to be done with robbers,
your best course is to appoint worthy men to office,
使教明於上
化行於下
and let them enlighten those above them
and reform those below them.

民有恥心
則何盜之為
If the people have a sense of shame,
why should they become robbers?’

***

於是用隨會知政
而群盜奔秦焉
Then the Marquis made Sui Hui chief minister,
and the robber bands fled to Ch’in.

孔子自衛反魯
息駕乎河梁
而觀焉
When Confucius was returning from Wei to Lu,
he rested his horses at a bridge over the river
and looked at the view.

有懸水三十仞
圜流九十里
There was a waterfall more than two hundred feet high,
and ninety miles of whirlpool;
魚鱉弗能游
黿鼉弗能居
fish and turtles could not swim there,
crocodiles could not live there,
有一丈夫
方將厲之
but there was a man
just about to ford it.

孔子使人並涯止之
曰
Confucius sent someone along the bank to stop him,
saying:

***

此懸水三十仞
圜流九十里
‘This waterfall is over two hundred feet high,
the whirlpool covers ninety miles;
魚鱉弗能游
黿鼉弗能居也
fish and turtles cannot swim here,
crocodiles cannot live here.

意者難可以濟乎
I would suggest it may be difficult to cross.’

***

丈夫不以錯意
遂度而出
The man took no notice,
crossed over and came out.

孔子問之曰
Confucius questioned him:

***

子巧乎
‘What skill!

有道術乎
Have you some special art?

所以能入而出者何也
How is it that you are able to get through?’

***

丈夫對曰
始吾之入也
先以忠信
‘When I first enter,
I start by being loyal and true to the water,
及吾之出也
又從以忠信
and when I come out,
I continue to be loyal and true to it.

忠信錯吾軀於波流
而吾不敢用私
Throwing my body into the current,
I do not dare to act selfishly.

所以能入
而復出者以此也
That is how I am able to get out again
once I am in.’

***

孔子謂弟子曰
Confucius said to his disciples:

***

二三子
識之
‘Bear it in mind,
my children.

水且猶可
以忠
信
誠身親之
而況人乎
By loyalty,
truth
and personal integrity
we can make friends even with the water,
not to speak of men!’[^8-6]

[^8-6]: This is a Confucian adaptation
(also found in the _Household Sayings of Confucius_)
of the story reproduced from the Taoist _Chuang-tzu_ in ch. 2.
There the swimmer trusted to the Tao of the water;
here, less plausibly,
he depends on the moral virtues loyalty and trustworthiness.

白公
問孔子曰
The Duke of Pai
asked Confucius:[^8-7]

***

人可與微言乎
‘Is it possible to hint to a man
without giving yourself away to others?’

***

孔子不應
Confucius did not answer.

***

白公問曰
若以石投水何如
‘Suppose I were to throw a stone into water?’

***

孔子曰
吳之善沒者能取之
‘A good diver from Wu could find it.’

***

曰
若以水投水何如
‘Suppose I throw water into water?’

***

孔子曰
淄澠之合
易牙嘗而知之
‘Mix the waters of the Tzu and the Sheng,
and Yi Ya[^8-8] would know by the taste.’

***

白公曰
人固不可與微言乎
‘Then is it really impossible to hint
without giving yourself away?’

***

孔子曰
何為不可
‘Why shouldn’t it be possible?

唯知言之謂者乎
But only with men who know what is behind words.

夫知言之謂者
不以言言也
The man who knows what is behind words
speaks without words.

> 爭魚者濡
Fishermen get wet,
逐獸者趨
Hunters get out of breath,

非樂之也
but not for the fun of it.

故至言去言
至為无為
Hence the utmost in speech is to be rid of speech,
the utmost doing is Doing Nothing.

夫淺知之所爭者末矣
Shallow minds contend for what does not matter.’

***

白公不得已
遂死於浴室
The Duke of Pai did not see the point,
and his death in the baths was the consequence.

[^8-7]: The Duke of Pai
was the grandson of King P’ing of Ch’u (528-516 B.C.).
After the execution of his father in Cheng,
he urged the Prime Minister of Ch’u to make war on Cheng.
Instead a Ch’u army was sent to help Cheng against an invasion by Chin.
The Duke rebelled,
killed the Prime Minister,
but was himself killed in a bath-house.

[^8-8]: Yi Ya, the chef of Duke Huan of Ch’i,
is the most famous of Chinese cooks.

趙襄子
使新穉穆子
攻翟
Chao Hsiang-tzǔ
sent Hsin-chih Mu-tzǔ
to attack Ti.

勝之
取左人中人
使遽人來謁之
The general was victorious,
took the towns of Tso-jen and Chung-jen,
and sent a runner to report the victory.

襄子
方食
而有憂色
Hsiang-tzǔ,
who was at dinner,
looked worried.

***

左右曰
一朝而兩城下
‘Two cities have fallen in a morning,’
his courtiers said.

此人之所以喜也
‘This should be enough to content anyone.

今君有憂色何也
Why do you look so worried?’

***

襄子曰
夫江河之大也
不過三日
‘The Yangtse and the Yellow River are at high tide
only for three days;
飄風暴雨
不終朝
stormy winds and fierce rains
do not last out the morning;
日中
不須臾
the sun is at high noon
for less than a moment.

今趙氏之德行
无所施於積
Now I have no steady accumulation
of noble deeds behind me.

一朝而兩城下
亡其及我哉
When two cities fall to me in a morning,
ruin will surely come to me!’

***

孔子聞之
曰
When Confucius heard of it,
he said:

***

趙氏其昌乎
‘Will not Chao Hsiang-tzǔ win glory?

> 夫憂者所以為昌也
Worrying leads to glory,
喜者所以為亡也
Contentment leads to ruin.’

***

勝非其難者也
To win is not the difficulty;
持之其難者也
the difficulty is to make victory last.

賢主以此持勝
故其福及後世
It is by worrying that a worthy prince makes victory last,
so that his good fortune passes on to later generations.

齊楚
吳越
Ch’i, Ch’u,
Wu, Yüeh,
皆嘗勝矣
然卒取亡焉
不達乎持勝也
all enjoyed victory in their time,
but were finally mined by victory,
because they did not fathom how to make it last.

唯有道之主
為能持勝
Only the prince who has the Way
is able to make victory last.

***

孔子之勁
能拓國門之關
而不肯以力聞
Confucius was strong enough
to lift the bar of the main gate of the capital,
but he did not wish to be renowned for strength.

墨子為守攻
公輸般服
而不肯以兵知
Mo-tzǔ made plans for defence
which Kung-shu Pan could not beat,
but he did not wish to be known as a warrior.

故善持勝者
以彊為弱
Therefore the man who is good at making victory last
represents his strength as weakness.

---

宋人有
好行仁義者
三世不懈
There was a family in Sung
which was unremitting in its love of virtuous conduct
for three generations.

家无故黑牛
生白犢
For no reason a black cow belonging to the family
gave birth to a white calf.

以問孔子
They asked Confucius about it.

***

孔子曰
此吉祥也
‘It is a fortunate omen,’
said Confucius.

以薦上帝
‘Offer it to God.’

***

居一年
其父无故而盲
A year later,
the father for no reason went blind.

***

其牛又復生白犢
其父又復令其子問孔子
Again the cow gave birth to a white calf,
and again the father ordered his son to ask Confucius.

***

其子曰
前問之而失明
又何問乎
‘The last time you asked him you lost your sight,
why ask him again?’

***

其父曰
聖人之言
先迕
後合
‘The words of a sage
at first seem to defy the facts,
later are seen to agree with them.

其事未究
姑復問之
We have not seen the end of this matter;
ask him again.’

***

其子又復問孔子
孔子曰
Again the son asked Confucius,
who said
吉祥也
復教以祭
the calf was a fortunate omen
and again instructed him to sacrifice it.

and let him show what he could do.

was to fasten to his legs
a pair of stilts
twice as long as himself,
並趨並馳

五劍常在空中
which he threw up in rotation,

子之年長矣
‘You are getting on in years.

Is there anyone in your family
whom I can send to find me horses?’

伯樂對曰
良馬
可形容
筋骨相也
‘A good horse
can be identified by its shape and look,
its bone and muscle.

相天下之馬者
若滅若沒
若亡若失
But the great horses of the world
might be extinct, vanished,
perished, lost;
若此者
絕塵
弭轍
such horses
raise no dust
and leave no tracks.

臣之子皆下才也
可告以良馬
而不可告以天下之馬也
My sons all have lesser talent,
they can pick a good horse
but not a great one.

臣有所與

有九方皋
But there is a man I know
who carries and hauls,
and collects firewood for me,

he is my equal.

displeased,
summoned Po-lo.

***

敗矣
子之所使求馬者
‘He’s no good,
the fellow you sent to find me horses.

色物
牝牡
尚弗能知
He cannot even tell
one colour from another,

What can he know about horses?’

伯樂喟然太息曰
Po-lo breathed a long sigh of wonder.

***

一至於此乎
‘So now he has risen to this!

是乃其所以

臣而无數者也
It is just this that shows
that he is worth a thousand,
ten thousand,

若皋之所觀者
天機也
What such a man as Kao observes
is the innermost native impulse behind the horse’s movements.

得其精
而忘其麤

and forgets the dross,
在其內

and forgets the outside.

見其所見
而不見其所不見

what he needs to see,

what he does not need to see.

there is something more important than horses.’

馬至
果天下之馬也
When the horse arrived,
it did prove to be a great horse.

the larger my salary,
the further shall my bounty extend.

以是
免於三怨可乎
Acting like this,
may I avoid the three causes of resentment?’

孫叔敖疾
將死
戒其子曰
When Sun Shu-ao was sick
and on the point of death,
he warned his son:

***

王亟封我矣
吾不受也
‘The King several times offered me a fief,
but I did not accept.

為我死
王則封汝
Should I die
he will make the same offer to you;
汝必无受利地
be sure not to accept strategically useful land.

楚越之閒
有寢丘者
Between Ch’u and Yüeh
is Graveyard Hill,
此地不利
而名甚惡
which is strategically useless land
with a very inauspicious name.

楚人鬼
而越人禨
The men of Ch’u fear ghosts
and the men of Yüeh believe in omens.

可長有者
唯此也
This is the only place
which can be owned for long.’

When Sun Shu-ao died,
the King did offer to enfief his son in excellent land.

其衣裝
車
They took all he had,
clothes and equipment,
carriage and horses.

視之歡然
无憂〼[^rse-8-1]之色

showed no sign of anxiety or regret.

盜追
而問其故
The robbers ran after him
and asked him why.

***

曰
君子
不以所養
害其所養
‘A gentleman
does not risk life for the sake of possessions,
which are means of supporting life.’

***

盜曰
嘻
賢矣夫
‘Ah,
a wise man, isn’t he?’
said the robbers.

既而相謂曰
But afterwards they talked it over:

***

以彼之賢
往見趙君
‘If such a wise man
goes to see the lord of Chao,
便以我為
必困我
and asks him to do something about us,
he will certainly get us into trouble.

不如殺之
We had better kill him.’

***

乃相與追
而殺之
So they all ran after him
and killed him.

***

燕人聞之
聚族相戒
曰
A man of Yen who heard about it
called together his clansmen and warned them:

***

遇盜
莫如上地之牛缺也
‘If you meet with robbers,
don’t be like Niu Ch’üeh of the highlands.’

and now you won’t stop running after us.

迹將箸焉
People will know which direction we took.

既為盜矣
仁將焉在
Once a man turns robber,
what room has he for kindness?’

***

遂殺之
又傍害其黨四五人焉
So they killed him,
and wounded four or five of his party into the bargain.

虞氏者
梁之富人也
Mr Yü
was a rich man of Liang.

家充殷盛
錢帛无量
財貨无訾
His family was at the height of its prosperity,
and he had more money and silk
and property than he could count.

登高樓
臨大路
One day he climbed a tall house
overlooking the main road,
設樂陳酒
擊博樓上
called for wine and music,
and played backgammon up at the top.

俠客相隨而行
樓上博者射
Some soldiers of fortune were walking together
in the street below.

明瓊張中
反兩㯓魚而笑
One of the players made a lucky throw,
and laughed as he turned over the two fish[^8-9].

飛鳶適墜其腐鼠
而中之
Just then a kite flying above dropped a mouldy rat
which hit one of the soldiers.

俠客相與言曰
The soldiers took council together:

***

虞氏富樂之日久矣
而常有輕易人之志
‘Yü has been rich and happy for many a day,
and he has always had an inclination to treat others too lightly.

吾不侵犯之
而乃辱我以腐鼠
We have done nothing to offend him,
yet he insults us with a mouldy rat.

此而不報
无以立慬於天下
If we fail to avenge such an insult as this,
we shall lose our reputation for courage in the eyes of the world.

請與若等戮力一志
率徒屬
必滅其家為等倫
Let us unite our efforts to one end,
bring all our men-at-arms and retainers,
and make sure of exterminating the whole family.’

***

皆許諾
The whole party agreed.

至期日之夜
聚眾積兵以攻虞氏
大滅其家
On the night appointed,
they assembled men and weapons to attack Yü
and exterminated the whole family.

[^8-9]: In this game (called _po_)
the pieces are advanced,
by throwing dice,
towards a ‘river’ across the middle of the board;
the player who takes two pieces in the river,
called ‘fish’,
is the winner.

東方有人焉
曰爰旌目
There was a man from the East
called Yüan Hsing-mu.

將有適也
而餓於道
He was travelling,
and lay starving on the road.

狐父之盜曰丘
見而下壺餐以餔之
A robber of Hu-fu called Ch’iu
saw him and handed food and water down to him.

爰旌目三餔
而後能視
Yüan Hsing-mu ate three mouthfuls
before his eyesight returned.

***

曰子何為者也
‘What man are you?’

***

曰我狐父之人丘也
‘I am Ch’iu of Hu-fu.’

***

爰旌目曰
譆
‘What?

汝非盜邪
Aren’t you a criminal?

胡為而食我
What do you mean by giving me food?

吾義
不食子之食也
I am a respectable man,
I will not eat your food.’

***

兩手據地而歐之
不出喀喀然
He pressed both hands against the ground to vomit it up,
but it stuck gurgling in his throat;
遂地而死
then he flopped on his face and died.

***

狐父之人則盜矣
而食非盜也
The man from Hu-fu was a criminal,
but there was nothing criminal about the food.

以人之盜
因謂食為盜而不敢食
是失名實者也
To call food criminal and refuse to eat it,
because the man who offers it is a criminal,
is to confuse the name and the reality.

柱厲叔
事莒敖公
Chu Li-shu
was in the service of Duke Ao of Chü.

自為不知己
去居海上
Feeling that the Duke did not appreciate him,
he went away and lived on the seashore,
夏日則食菱芰
冬日則食橡栗
eating water-chestnuts and lotus-seeds in the summer,
and chestnuts and acorns in the winter.

莒敖公有難
柱厲叔辭其友
而往死之
But when Duke Ao was in trouble,
he took leave of his friends and went
to fight to the death for him.

***

其友曰
子自以為不知己
故去
‘You felt that the Duke did not appreciate you,’
his friends said,
‘and that is why you left him.

今往死之
是知與不知
无辨也
If you go and die for him now,
it will have made no difference
whether he appreciated you or not.’

***

柱厲叔曰
不然
‘Not at all.

自以為不知
故去
I left because
I felt that he did not appreciate me;
今死
是果不知我也
and to die for him now
will prove that he did not appreciate me.

吾將死之
以醜後世之人主之
不知其臣者也
I shall die for him
in order to shame the lords of future generations
who do not appreciate their vassals.’

***

凡知則死之
不知則弗死
此直道而行者也
To die for a lord who appreciates you,
and refuse to die for a lord who does not,
this is walking straight in the Way.

***

柱厲叔可謂
懟以
忘其身者也
We may call Chu Li-shu
a man who carried resentment to the point
of no longer caring for his own life.[^8-10]

[^8-10]: This and the preceding story
come from the _Lü-shih ch’un-ch’iu_ (c. 240 B.C.),
in which Yuan Hsing-mu and Chu Li-shu
are presented as heroes.
The editor of the _Lieh-tzǔ_ thinks differently.

楊朱曰
Yang Chu said:

***

利出者
實反
‘If benefit goes out from you
the fruits will return to you;
怨往者
害來
if resentment goes forth from you
harm will come back to you.

發於此
而應於外者
唯請
What issues from within
and is answered outside
is mere passion.

是故賢者
慎所出
Therefore the wise man is careful
of what he lets go out.’

***

楊子之鄰人亡羊
既率其黨
又請楊子之豎追之
A neighbour of Yang Chu lost a sheep.
Not only did he lead out all his retainers to chase it,
he also begged servants from Yang Chu.

***

楊子曰
嘻
‘Curious!

亡一羊
何追者之眾
You have lost only one sheep,
why do you need so many people to chase it?’

***

鄰人曰
多岐路
‘There are many forks in the road.’

When they returned,
Yang Chu asked:

獲羊乎
‘Did you catch the sheep?’

曰亡之矣
‘No,
we lost it.’

曰奚亡之
‘How did you come to lose it?’

曰岐路之中又有岐焉
‘There were other forks inside the forks.

We did not know which road to take,
so turned back.’

***

楊子戚然變容
A worried expression came over Yang Chu’s face.

不言者移時
不笑者竟日
He did not talk for some time,
did not smile for the rest of the day.

門人怪之
請曰
His disciples found this strange
and inquired about it.

***

羊賤畜
又非夫子之有
‘A sheep is an inexpensive animal,
and in any case it was not yours.

而損言笑者何哉
Why should this stop you talking and smiling?’

***

楊子不荅
門人不獲所命
Yang Chu did not answer,
and the disciples could get nothing out of him.

弟子孟孫陽出
以告心都子
His disciple Meng Sun-yang went out
and told Hsin-tu-tzǔ.

心都子他日
與孟孫陽偕入
而問曰
On another day Hsin-tu-tzǔ
came in with Meng-Sun-yang
and asked Yang Chu a question:

***

昔有昆弟三人
游齊魯之閒
‘Once there were three brothers
who travelled in Ch’i and Lu,
同師而學
進仁義之道
而歸
studied under the same teachers,
and came home knowing all there is to know
about the principles of moral duty.

其父曰
Their father asked them:

***

仁義之道
若何
‘“What can you tell me
about the principles of moral duty?”

***

伯曰
‘The eldest said:
仁義
使我愛身
而後名
“Moral duty
makes me take care of my body
and put it before my reputation.”[^8-11]

***

仲曰
‘The next said:
仁義
使我殺身
以成名
“Moral duty
makes me kill my body
for the sake of my reputation.”

叔曰
‘The youngest said:
仁義
使我身名
並全
“Moral duty
makes me preserve
both body and reputation.”

***

彼三術相反
而同出於儒
‘Those three doctrines are contradictory,
yet have the same source in Confucianism.

孰是
孰非邪
Which is right
and which is wrong?’

***

楊子曰
人有濱河而居者
‘There was a man who lived by the riverside,’
answered Yang Chu.

習於水
勇於泅
‘He was familiar with water
and a bold swimmer,
操舟鬻渡
利供百口
he made his living as a boatman ferrying people across,
and the profits supported a hundred people.

裹糧就學者
成徒

A crowd of people
came with their bundles of provisions to learn from him,
but nearly half were drowned.

本學泅
不學溺
They wanted to learn how to swim,
not how to drown,
而利害
如此
but you can see to what an extent
some were harmed while others benefited.

若以為
孰是
孰非
Which of them do you think
were right
and which wrong?’

***

心都子嘿然而出
Hsin-tu-tzǔ came out in silence.

孟孫陽讓之曰
Meng Sun-yang upbraided him:

***

何吾子問之迂
夫子荅之僻
‘Why did you ask in such a roundabout way,
and why did the Master give such an obscure answer?

吾惑愈甚
I am more puzzled then ever.’

***

心都子曰
大道
以多岐
亡羊
‘Our neighbour lost his sheep
on the highroad
because there were many forks;
學者

喪生
the ferryman’s apprentices
lost their lives
because there were many methods.

學非本不同
非本不一
The root of what they were learning
was one and the same,
而末異
若是
but you can see how far
the tips of the branches had diverged.

唯歸同
反一
Only return to where they are one,
go back to where they are the same,
為亡
得喪
restore the missing
and find the lost.

子長先生之門
習先生之道
而不達先生之況也
哀哉
How sad that you,
who have grown old as his disciple
and are familiar with his Way,
should fail to see through the Master’s parable!’

[^8-11]: It was the duty of a Confucian to keep his body unmutilated,
since it is a gift received from his ancestors.
This, as the story points out,
is hard to reconcile with other duties.

There was once a man
who said he knew the Way to become immortal.

燕君

But a favourite minister protested:

and there is nothing that he values
more than his life.

That man has lost his own life,
how could he have made you immortal?’

So he did not execute him.

A certain Ch’i-tzǔ
also wished to learn this Way,

Another philosopher,
Fu-tzǔ,
heard about it and laughed at him,
saying:

***

夫所欲學不死

and is vexed when the teacher dies himself,
does not know what it is he wants to learn.’

When you release doves after catching them,

[^rse-8-2]: ‘Chien’ is U+25CD1 (⿱竹閒) in _Sibu congkan_,
here and in the rest of this passage
where 〼 replaces this unprintable character.

[^8-12]: Minister of Duke Ting (511-474 B.C.) of Chin.

齊田氏
T’ien of Ch’i
was going on a journey;
祖於庭
食客千人
he sacrificed in his courtyard to the god of the roads,
and banqueted a thousand guests.

中坐有獻魚鴈者
Someone was serving fish and geese at the seat of honour.

田氏視之
乃歎曰
T’ien looked at them;
then he sighed and said:

***

天之於民厚矣
‘How generous heaven is to mankind!

殖五穀
生魚鳥
以為之用
It grows the five grains
and breeds the fish and birds
for the use of man.’

***

眾客和之如響
All the guests answered like his echo.

鮑氏之子年十二
預於次
進曰
But a twelve-year-old boy of the Pao family,
who had a seat among the guests,
came forward and said:

不如君言
‘It is not as your lordship says.

天地萬物
與我並生類也
The myriad things between heaven and earth,
born in the same way that we are,
do not differ from us in kind.

類无貴賤
One kind is no nobler than another;
徒以小大
智力而相制
it is simply that the stronger and cleverer
rule the weaker and sillier.

迭相食
非相為而生之
Things take it in turns to eat each other,
but they are not bred for each other’s sake.

人取可食者而食之
豈
天本為人生之
Men take the things which are edible and eat them,
but how can it be claimed
that heaven bred them originally for the sake of man?

且
蚊蚋噆膚
虎狼食肉
Besides,
mosquitoes and gnats bite our skin,
tigers and wolves eat our flesh;
非天本為
蚊蚋生人
虎狼生肉者哉
did heaven originally
breed man for the sake of mosquitoes and gnats,
and his flesh
for the sake of tigers and wolves?’

齊有貧者
常乞於城市
There was a poor man in Ch’i
who always begged in the city market.

城市患其亟也
眾莫之與
The crowd in the market got tired of seeing him so often,
and no one would give him anything.

遂適田氏之廄
從馬醫作役
而假食郭中
So he went to the stables of the T’ien family,
and made a living
as a horse-doctor’s servant.

人戲之曰
The people in the suburbs made fun of him:

***

從馬醫而食
不以辱乎
‘Don’t you think it a disgrace
to be kept by a horse-doctor?’

***

乞兒曰
天下之辱莫過於乞
‘There is nothing in the world more disgraceful than to beg.

乞猶不辱
豈辱馬醫哉
If even begging did not disgrace me,
how can I be disgraced by a horse-doctor?’

宋人有
游於道
得人遺契者
There was a man of Sung
who was strolling in the street
and picked up a half tally someone had lost.

歸而藏之
密數其齒
He took it home and stored it away,
and secretly counted the indentations of the broken edge.

告鄰人曰
He told a neighbour:

***

吾富可待矣
‘I shall be rich any day now.’

---

人有枯梧樹者
There was a man who owned a withered _wu-t’ung_ tree.

其鄰父
言枯梧之樹不祥
The old man next door
said that a withered _wu-t’ung_ is unlucky,
其鄰人
遽而伐之
so he hurried
to chop it down.

鄰人父
因請以為薪
The man next door
took the chance to beg it for firewood.

其人乃不悅曰
This displeased him.

***

鄰人之父
徒欲為薪
而教吾伐之也
‘The old man next door
taught me to chop it down
simply because he wanted it for firewood.

與我鄰若此
其險豈可哉
That my own neighbour
should be so tricky!’

---

人有亡鈇者
意其鄰之子
There was a man who lost his axe,
and suspected the boy next door.

視其行步
竊鈇也
He watched the boy walking:
he had stolen the axe!

顏色
竊鈇也
His expression,
言語
竊鈇也
his talk,
動作
態度
his behaviour,
his manner,
无為
而不竊鈇也
everything about him
betrayed that he had stolen the axe.

***

俄而抇其谷
而得其鈇
Soon afterwards the man was digging in his garden
and found the axe.

他日復
見其鄰人之子
On another day
he saw the boy next door again;
動作態度
无似竊鈇者
nothing in his behaviour and manner
suggested that he would steal an axe.

白公
勝慮亂
The Duke of Pai
was meditating rebellion.

罷朝而立
倒杖策
錣上貫頤
Coming out of court,
he stood leaning on his horse-goad,
without remembering to hold it right way up.

血流
至地
而弗知也
The point stuck in his cheek
and the blood ran down to the ground,
but he did not notice it.

***

鄭人聞之曰
頤之忘
將何不忘哉
‘If he forgets his own head,’
said the men of Cheng when they heard of it,
‘is there anything he will not forget?’[^8-13]

***

意之所屬箸
其行足躓株埳
頭抵植木
而不自知也
When a man’s thoughts are fixed on something,
he walks stumbling over treestumps and holes,
and knocking his head on door-posts and trees,
without coming to himself.

[^8-13]: The men of Cheng
had killed the Duke of Pai’s father (cf. p. 167 above).
They think he has forgotten it;
actually his plans of revenge are the reason for his absent-mindedness.

昔齊人
有欲金者
Once there was a man of Ch’i
who wanted gold.

清旦被衣冠
而之市
At dawn he put on his coat and cap
and set out for market.

適鬻金者之所
因攫其金而去
He went to the stall of a dealer in gold,
snatched his gold and made off.

吏捕得之
問曰
The police caught him
and questioned him.

***

人皆在焉
子攫人之金何
‘Why did you snatch somebody else’s gold
in front of so many people?’

***

對曰
取金之時
不見人
徒見金
‘At the time when I took it,
I did not see the people,
I only saw the gold.’
