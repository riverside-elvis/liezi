## 楊朱 Yang Chu

楊朱游於魯
舍於孟氏
Yang Chu travelled in Lu,
and lodged with Mr Meng.

***

孟氏問曰
Mr Meng asked him a question.

***

人而已矣
‘We are simply the men we are.

奚以名為
What use is reputation?’

***

曰
以名者為富
---‘A reputation helps us to get rich.’

***

既富矣
奚不已焉
‘Once rich,
why not be done with it?’

***

曰
為貴
---‘It helps us to win high rank.’

***

既貴矣
奚不已焉
‘Once we have high rank,
why not be done with it?’

***

曰
為死
---‘It will help when we are dead.’

***

既死矣
奚為焉
‘Once dead,
what good will it do us?’

***

曰
為子孫
---‘It will help our descendants.’

***

名奚益於子孫
‘What use will our reputations be to our descendants?’

***

曰
名乃
苦其身
燋其心
---‘Caring for reputation
vexes the body
and withers the heart;
乘其名者
澤及宗族
利兼鄉黨
況子孫乎
but the man who takes advantage of his reputation
can prosper his whole clan
and benefit his whole district,
not to speak of his own descendants.’

***

凡為名者
必廉廉
斯貧
‘But whoever cares for reputation
must be honest,
and if honest he will be poor.

為名者
必讓
讓斯賤
He must be humble,
and if humble he will not rise in rank.’

***

曰
管仲之相齊也
君淫亦淫
君奢亦奢
---‘When Kuan Chung was chief minister in Ch’i,
he was lewd when his ruler was lewd,
extravagant when his ruler was extravagant.

志合言從
道行國霸
He accorded with his ruler in thought and in speech,
and by the practice of his Way the state won hegemony;
死之後
管氏而已
but after his death,
the Kuan family was still only the Kuan family.

田氏之相齊也
君盈則己降
君歛則己施
When T’ien Heng was chief minister in Ch’i,
he behaved unassumingly when his ruler was arrogant,
behaved generously when his ruler was grasping.

民皆歸之
因有齊國
The people all went over to him,
and in this way he won possession of the state of Ch’i,
子孫享之
至今不絕
and his descendants have enjoyed it without interruption
down to the present day.’[^7-1]

***

若實名
貧
‘So if you really live up to your reputation,
you will be poor;
偽名
富
if your reputation is pretence,
you will be rich.’

***

曰
實無名
名無實
---‘Reality has nothing to do with reputation,
reputation has nothing to do with reality.

名者
偽而已矣
Reputation
is nothing but pretence.

昔者
堯舜
偽以天下讓
許由
善卷
Formerly
Yao and Shun
pretended to resign the Empire
to Hsü Yu
and Shan Chüan
而不失天下
享祚
百年
but did not give it up,
and were blessed with its possession
for a hundred years.

伯夷
叔齊
實以孤竹君讓
Po Yi
and Shu Ch’i,
who really resigned the fief of Ku-chu,
而終亡其國
餓死於首陽之山
did end by losing this state,
and died of starvation on Mount Shou-yang.[^7-2]

實偽之辯
如此其省也
The difference between the reality and the pretence
could not be put more plainly.’

[^7-1]: For Kuan Chung,
who lived up to his reputation as a good minister, cf. p. 124.
For T’ien Heng, whose good reputation was pretence, cf. p. 122.

[^7-2]: Hsü Yu and Shan Chüan were hermits
who rejected the offer of the Imperial throne
because they refused to burden themselves with worldly cares.
For Po Yi and Shu Ch’i, cf. p. 122.

楊朱曰
Yang Chu said:

***

百年
壽之大齊
‘A hundred years
is the term of the longest life,
得百年者
千无一焉
but not one man in a thousand
lives so long.

設有一者
孩抱以逮昏老
幾居其半矣
Should there be one who lives out his span,
infancy and senility
take nearly half of it.

夜眠之所弭
晝覺之所遺又
幾居其半矣
The nights lost in sleep,
the days wasted even when we are awake,
take nearly half the rest.

痛疾
哀苦
Pain and sickness,
sorrow and toil,
亡失
憂懼
ruin and loss,
anxiety and fear,
又幾居其半矣
take nearly half of the rest.

量十數年之中
Of the dozen or so years which remain,
if we reckon how long
逌然而自得
亡介焉之慮者
we are at ease and content,
without the least care,
亦亡一時之中爾
it does not amount to the space of an hour.

***

則人之生也奚為哉
‘Then what is a man to live for?

奚樂哉
Where is he to find happiness?

為美厚爾
為聲色爾
Only in fine clothes and good food,
music and beautiful women.

而美厚復
不可常
猒足
But we cannot always
have enough good clothes
and food to satisfy us,
聲色
不可常
翫聞
cannot always
be playing with women
and listening to music.

乃復
為刑賞之所禁勸
Then again,
we are checked by punishments
and seduced by rewards,
名法之所進退
led forward by the hope of reputation,
driven back by fear of the law.

遑遑爾
競一時之虛譽
規死後之餘榮
Busily
we compete for an hour’s empty praise,
and scheme for glory which will outlast our deaths;
偊偊爾
順耳目之觀聽
惜身意之是非
even in our solitude
we comply with what we see others do, hear others say,
and repent of what our own thoughts approve and reject.

徒失當年之至樂
不能自肆於一時
In vain we lose the utmost enjoyment of the prime of life,
we cannot give ourselves up to the hour.

重囚纍梏
何以异哉
How are we different
from prisoners weighted with chains and fetters?

***

太古之人
知生之暫來
知死之暫往
‘The men of the distant past
knew that in life we are here for a moment
and in death we are gone for a moment.[^7-3]

故
從心而動
不違自然所好
Therefore
they acted as their hearts prompted,
and did not rebel against their spontaneous desires;
當身之娛
非所去也
故不為名所勤
while life lasted
they did not refuse its pleasures,
and so they were not seduced by the hope of reputation.

從性而游
不逆萬物所好
They roamed as their nature prompted,
and did not rebel against the desires common to all things;
死後之名
非所取也
故不為刑所及
they did not prefer
a reputation after death,
and so punishment did not affect them.

名譽先後
年命多少
非所量也
Whether they were reputed and praised more or less than others,
whether their destined years were many or few,
they did not take into account.

[^7-3]: The suggestion of the Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation (cf. p. 15) is curious;
elsewhere the hedonist author assumes the finality of death.’

楊朱曰
Yang Chu said:

***

萬物
所異者
生也
‘It is in life
that the myriad things of the world
are different;
所同者
死也
in death
they are all the same.

生則有
賢愚
貴賤
In life,
there are clever and foolish,
noble and vile;
是所異也
these are the differences.

死則有
臭腐
消滅
In death,
there are stench and rot,
decay and extinction;
是所同也
in this we are all the same.

***

雖然
‘However,
賢愚
貴賤
非所能也
whether we are clever or foolish,
noble or vile,
is not our own doing,
臭腐
消滅
亦非所能也
and neither are
stench and rot,
decay and extinction.

故
生非所生
死非所死
Hence
we do not bring about
our own life
or death,
賢非所賢
愚非所愚
cleverness
or foolishness,
貴非所貴
賤非所賤
nobility
or vileness.

然而
萬物
However,
the myriad things
齊生齊死
齊賢齊愚
齊貴齊賤
all equally live and die,
are equally clever and foolish,
noble and vile.[^7-4]

***

十年亦死
百年亦死
‘Some in ten years,
some in a hundred,
we all die;
仁聖亦死
凶愚亦死
saints and sages die,
the wicked and foolish die.

生則堯舜
死則腐骨
In life they were Yao and Shun,
in death they are rotten bones;
生則桀紂
死則腐骨
in life they were Chieh and Chou,
in death they are rotten bones.

腐骨一矣
孰知其異
Rotten bones are all the same,
who can tell them apart?

且趣當生
奚遑死後
Make haste to enjoy your life while you have it;
why care what happens when you are dead?’

[^7-4]: This looks like a Taoist interpolation,
in the manner of the Endeavour and Destiny chapter.

楊朱曰
Yang Chu said:

***

伯夷非亡欲
矜清之郵
以放餓死
‘It is not that Po Yi had no desires,
his was the worst sort of pride in one’s own purity,
and because of it he starved to death.

展季非亡情
矜貞之郵
以放寡宗
It is not that Chan Ch’in had no passions,
his was the worst sort of pride in one’s own correctness,
and because of it he weakened his clan.

清貞之
誤善之若此
They went to these extremes in treating
mistaken “purity” and “correctness” as virtues.’[^7-5]

[^7-5]: For Po Yi and Chan Ch’in, cf. p. 122.

楊朱曰
Yang Chu said:

***

原憲窶於魯
子貢殖於衛
‘Yüan Hsien grew poor in Lu,
Tzǔ-kung grew rich in Wei.[^7-6]

原憲之窶損生
子貢之殖累身
Yüan Hsien’s poverty injured his life,
Tzǔ-kung’s wealth involved him in trouble.’

***

然則
窶亦不可
殖亦不可
‘If that is so,
wealth
and poverty are both bad;
其可焉在
where is the right course to be found?’

***

曰
可在樂生
可在逸身
‘It is to be found in enjoying life,
in freeing ourselves from care.

故
善樂生者
不窶
Hence
those who are good at enjoying life
are not poor,
善逸身者
不殖
and those who are good at freeing themselves from care
do not get rich.’

[^7-6]: Two disciples of Confucius.

楊朱曰
Yang Chu said:

***

古語有之
生相憐
死相捐
‘There is an old saying
that each of us should pity the living
and abandon the dead.

此語至矣
This saying puts it exactly.

相憐之道
非唯情也
The way to pity others
is not simply to feel for them.

勤能使逸
饑能使飽
When they are toiling we can give them ease,
hungry we can feed them,
寒能使溫
窮能使達也
cold we can warm them,
in trouble we can help them to get through.

相捐之道
非不相哀也
The way to abandon the dead
is not to refuse to feel sorry for them.

不含珠玉
不服文錦
But we should not
put pearls or jade in their mouths,
dress them in brocades,
不陳犧牲
不設明器也
lay out sacrificial victims,
prepare funeral vessels.’

---

晏平仲問養生
於管夷吾
Yen-tzǔ asked Kuan Chung about ‘tending life’,[^7-7]
Kuan Chung answered:

***

管夷吾曰
肆之而已
‘It is simply living without restraint;
勿壅
勿閼
do not suppress,
do not restrict.’

***

晏平仲曰
其目柰何
‘Tell me the details.’

***

夷吾曰
恣耳之所欲聽
恣目之所欲視
‘Give yourself up to whatever
your ears wish to listen to,
your eyes to look on,
恣鼻之所欲向
恣口之所欲言
your nostrils to turn to,
your mouth to say,
恣體之所欲安
恣意之所欲行
your body to find ease in,
your will to achieve.

夫耳之所欲聞
者音聲
What the ears wish to hear
is music and song,
而不得聽
謂之閼聰
and if these are denied them,
I say that the sense of hearing is restricted.

目之所欲見者
美色
What the eyes wish to see
is the beauty of women,
而不得視
謂之閼明
and if this is denied them,
I say that the sense of sight is restricted.

鼻之所欲向者
椒蘭
What the nostrils wish to turn to
is orchids and spices,
而不得嗅
謂之閼顫
and if these are denied them,
I say that the sense of smell is restricted.

口之所欲道者是非
What the mouth wishes to discuss
is truth and falsehood,
而不得言
謂之閼智
and if this is denied it,
I say that the intelligence is restricted.

體之所欲安者
美厚
What the body wishes to find ease in
is fine clothes and good food,
而不得從
謂之閼適
and if these are denied it,
I say that its comfort is restricted.

意之所欲為者
放逸
What the will wishes to achieve
is freedom and leisure,
而不得行
謂之閼性
and if it is denied these,
I say that man’s nature is restricted.

***

凡此諸閼
廢虐之主
‘All these restrictions
are oppressive masters.

去廢虐之主
熙熙然以俟死
If you can rid yourself of these oppressive masters,
and wait serenely for death,
一日一月
一年十年
吾所謂養
whether you last a day, a month,
a year, ten years,
it will be what I call “tending life”.

拘此廢虐之主
錄而不舍
If you are bound to these oppressive masters,
and cannot escape their ban,
戚戚然以至久生
百年千年萬年
非吾所謂養
though you were to survive miserably
for a hundred years, a thousand, ten thousand,
I would not call it “tending life”.’

***

管夷吾曰
Then Kuan Chung in his turn questioned Yen-tzǔ:

***

吾既告子養生矣
‘I have told you about “tending life”.

送死柰何
What can you tell me about taking leave of the dead?’

***

晏平仲曰
送死略矣
‘It does not matter how we take leave of the dead.

將何以告焉
What is there to say about it?’

***

管夷吾曰
吾固欲聞之
‘I insist on hearing.’

***

平仲曰
既死
豈在我哉
‘Once I am dead,
what concern is it of mine?

焚之亦可
沈之亦可
It is the same to me
whether you burn me
or sink me in a river,
瘞之亦可
露之亦可
bury me
or leave me in the open,
衣薪
而棄諸溝壑亦可
throw me in a ditch
wrapped in grass
袞文繡裳
而納諸石椁亦可
or put me in a stone coffin
dressed in a dragon-blazoned jacket and embroidered skirt.

唯所遇焉
I leave it to chance.’

***

管夷吾
顧謂
鮑叔
黃子
曰
Kuan Chung
turned to
Pao Shu-ya
and Huang-tzǔ,
and said:

***

生死之道
吾二人進之矣
‘Between the two of us,
we have said all that there is to say
about the Way to live and to die.’

[^7-7]: The phrase _yang-sheng_ (‘tending life’, ‘tending the living’)
had different meanings for different schools.
For individualists of the 4th century B.C.
(deriving from the historical Yang Chu himself)
it meant the satisfaction of personal needs
without injuring health and life.
For Confucians, ‘tending the living’ and ‘taking leave of the dead’
were the filial duties of supporting and decently burying one’s parents.
The present passage gives the Confucian terms a hedonist reinterpretation.

子產相鄭
Tzǔ-ch’an was chief minister in Cheng.

專國之政三年
善者服其化
惡者畏其禁
Within three years of his taking sole charge of the government,
the good had submitted to his reforms
and the wicked dreaded his prohibitions;
鄭國以治
諸侯憚之
the state of Cheng was in good order
and the other states were afraid of it.

而有兄曰公孫朝
有弟曰公孫穆
朝好酒
穆好色
But he had an elder brother called Kung-sun Ch’ao
who was fond of wine,
and a younger brother called Kung-sun Mu
who was fond of women.

朝之室也
聚酒千鐘
積麴成封
Chao had collected in his house
a thousand jars of wine
and a whole hillock of yeast for brewing;
望門百步
糟漿之氣逆於人鼻
and for a hundred paces outside his door
the smell of the dregs came to meet men’s nostrils.

方其荒於酒也
不知
When he was carried away by wine,
he did not know
世道之安危
人理之悔吝
whether there was peace or war in the world,
he did not notice mistakes which he had time to repent,
室內之有亡
九族之親踈
存亡之哀樂也
he forgot the possessions in his own house,
the degrees of affinity of his kinsmen,
and that it is better to live than to die.

雖水火
兵刃交於前
弗知也
Even if he had stood in water or fire
with sword blades clashing before him,
he would not have known it.

***

穆之後庭
比房數十
皆擇稚齒婑媠者以盈之
In the back courtyard of Mu’s house
there was a row of several dozen rooms,
and he picked young and lovely girls to fill them.

方其聃於色也
屏親昵
絕交游
When he was excited by lust,
he shut the door on his kinsmen
and stopped meeting and going out with his friends;
逃於後庭
以晝足夜
he fled into his harem,
where the nights were too short to satisfy him,
三月一出
意猶未愜
and felt thwarted
if he had to come out once in three months.

鄉有處子之娥姣者
必賄而招之
媒而挑之
弗獲而後已
Any beautiful virgin in the district
he was sure to tempt with gifts
and invite through go-betweens,
giving up only if he could not catch her.

***

子產
日夜以為戚
密造鄧析而謀之
Tzǔ-ch’an,
who worried about them night and day,
went privately to consult Teng Hsi.

***

曰
喬聞
‘I have heard,’
he said,
治身
以及家
‘that a man should influence his family
by setting his own life in order,
治家
以及國
influence the state
by setting his own family in order---
此言
自於近
至於遠也
meaning that
the example you set to those nearest to you
extends to those further away.

喬為國則治矣
而家則亂矣
My administration has set the state in order,
yet my family is in anarchy.

其道逆邪
Have I been doing things the wrong way round?

將奚方以救二子
子其詔之
Tell me a method
of helping these two men.’

***

鄧析曰
吾怪之久矣
未敢先言
‘I have long marvelled at it,’
said Teng Hsi,
‘but did not wish to be the first to raise the question.

子奚不時其治也
喻以性命之重
誘以禮義之尊乎
Why not look out for an opportunity to set their lives in order,
make them understand the importance of keeping their health,
appeal to their respect for propriety and duty?’

***

子產用鄧析之言
Tzǔ-ch’an took his advice.

因閒以謁其兄弟而告之
曰
He found an opportunity to visit his brothers,
and told them:

***

人之所以貴於禽獸者
智慮
‘It is knowledge and foresight
which make man nobler than the beasts and birds.

智慮之所將者
禮義
Knowledge and foresight lead us to
propriety and duty.

禮義成
則名位至矣
Learn to live properly and dutifully,
and reputation and office will be yours.

若觸情而動
聃於嗜慾
則性命危矣
But if you act on the promptings of your passions,
and excite yourselves with pleasure and lust,
you will endanger health and life.

子納喬之言
則朝自悔
而夕食祿矣
Should you listen to what I say,
you can repent in a morning
and draw your salaries by the evening.’

***

朝穆曰
Chao and Mu answered:

***

吾知之久矣
擇之亦久矣
‘We have long known it,
and long since made our choice.

豈待若言而後識之哉
Why should we need your advice to make us see it?

凡生之難遇
而死之易及
Always life is precious
and death comes too soon.

以難遇之生
俟易及之死
可孰念哉
We must never forget
that we are living this precious life,
waiting for death which comes too soon;
而欲尊禮義
以夸人
and to wish to impress others
with your respect for propriety and duty,
矯情性以招名
吾以此為弗若死矣
distorting your natural passions to call up a good name,
in our judgement is worse than death.

為欲盡一生之歡
窮當年之樂
We wish to enjoy this single life to the full,
draining the utmost pleasure from its best years.

唯患
腹溢而不得恣口之飲
力憊而不得肆情於色
For us the only misfortune
is a belly too weak to drink without restraint,
potency which fails before our lust is satisfied.

不遑憂
名聲之醜
性命之危也
We have no time to worry
that our reputation is ugly
and our health in danger.

***

且
若以治國之能夸物
欲以說辭亂我之心
榮祿喜我之意
不亦鄙而可憐哉
‘Besides,
is it not mean and pitiable that you,
whom success in ruling the state has made proud,
should wish to disturb our hearts with sophistries,
and flatter our thoughts with hopes of glory and salary?

我又欲與若別之
We in our turn would like to dispute the issue with you.

夫善治外者
物未必治
而身交苦
The man who is good at ordering the lives of others
does not necessarily succeed,
but overworks himself trying.

善治內者
物未必亂
而性交逸
The man who is good at ordering his own life
gives scope to his nature
without needing to disorder the lives of others.

以若之治外
其法可蹔行於一國
未合於人心
Your method of ruling others
may be realised temporarily in a single state,
but it is out of accord with men’s hearts.

以我之治內
可推之於天下
君臣之道息矣
Our method of ruling ourselves
may be extended to the whole world,
until the Way of ruler and subject is brought to an end.

吾常欲以此術而喻之
若反以彼術而教我哉
We have long wanted to make you understand our way of life,
but on the contrary it is you who come to teach us yours!’

***

子產忙然无以應之
Tzǔ-ch’an was bewildered and had no answer to give.

他日以告鄧析
鄧析曰
On another day he told Teng Hsi,
who said:

***

子與真人居而不知也
‘You have been living with True Men without knowing it.

孰謂子智者乎
Who says you are a wise man?

鄭國之治偶耳
非子之功也
The good government of the state of Cheng is mere chance,
you cannot take the credit for it.’

衛端木叔者
子貢之世也
Tuan-mu Shu of Wei
was a descendant of Tzǔ-kung.[^7-8]

藉其先貲
家累萬金
He lived on his inheritance,
a family property worth ten thousand pieces of gold.

不治世故
放意所好
He did not bother with the issues of his time,
but followed his impulse and did as he pleased.

其生民之所欲為
人意之所欲玩者
The things which all men desire to do,
with which our inclinations desire to be amused,
无不為也

his food and drink,
carriages and dress,
聲樂
嬪御
singers and musicians,
wife and concubines,

bore comparison with those of the rulers of Ch’i and Ch’u.

至其情所欲好
耳所欲聽
Whatever his passions inclined him to enjoy,
whatever his ear wished to hear,
目所欲視
口所欲嘗
his eye to see
and his mouth to taste,
雖殊方偏國
非齊土之所產育者
无不必致之
猶藩牆之物也
he would send for without fail,
even if it came from a different region or a border country
and was not a product of the Middle Kingdom,
as though it were something from just across his wall or his hedge.

及其游也
雖山川阻險
塗逕脩遠
无不必之
猶人之行咫步也
When he travelled
he always went wherever he pleased,
however perilous the mountains and rivers,
however long and distant the roads,
as other men walk a few paces.

賓客在庭者
日百住
Every day
the guests in his court were counted in hundreds,
庖廚之下
不絕煙火
and down in his kitchen
the fire never went out,
堂廡之上
不絕聲樂
up in his hall and chambers
the musicians never stopped playing.

奉養之餘
先散之宗族
宗族之餘
The leftovers of his banquets
he scattered far and wide,
first in his own clan,
次散之邑里
邑里之餘
next in the town and the villages around,
乃散之一國
finally all over the country.

***

行年六十
氣幹將衰
When he reached the age of sixty,
and his vitality and health were beginning to wane,
棄
其家事
he let go
of his family affairs,
都散

珍寶
and gave away
all the precious things
in his treasuries and storehouses,
車服
妾媵
all his carriages and robes
and concubines,
一年之中盡焉
不為子孫留財
finishing them all within a year,
keeping nothing for his own children and grandchildren.

及其病也
无藥石之儲
When he fell ill,
he had no medicine or needle in store;
及其死也
无瘞埋之資
and when he died,
lacked the price of his own burial.

一國之人
受其施者
The people throughout the whole country
who had enjoyed his bounty
相與賦而藏之
反其子孫之財焉
made a collection among themselves to bury him,
and restored the property of his children and grandchildren.

asked Yang Chu:

***

有人於此
貴生

‘Suppose that a man
values his life
and takes care of his body;
以蘄不死可乎
may he hope by such means to live for ever?’

***

曰
理无不死
‘It is impossible to live for ever.’

***

以蘄久生可乎
‘May he hope to prolong his life?’

***

曰
理无久生
‘It is impossible to prolong life.

生非貴之所能存
身非愛之所能厚
Valuing life cannot preserve it,
taking care of the body cannot do it good.

且
久生奚為
Besides,
what is the point of prolonging life?

五情
好惡
古猶今也
Our five passions,
our likes and dislikes,
are the same now as they were of old.

四體
安危
古猶今也
The safety and danger

世事

the joy and bitterness

變易

changes of fortune,
good government and discord,
are the same now as they were of old.

既聞之矣

既更之矣
We have heard it already,
seen it already,
experienced it already.

百年猶厭其多
Even a hundred years is enough to satiate us;
況久生之苦也乎
could we endure the bitterness of still longer life?’

孟孫陽曰
若然
速亡
愈於久生
‘If it is so,

is better than prolonged life,
則踐鋒刃
入湯火
得所志矣
you can get what you want
by treading on blades and spearpoints,
rushing into fire and boiling water.’

楊子曰
不然
‘No.

既生
則廢而任之
While you are alive,
resign yourself and let life run its course;
究其所欲
以俟於死
satisfy all your desires

將死

When it is time to die,
resign yourself and let death run its course;
究其所之

无不廢
无不任
Be resigned to everything,

何遽遟速於其閒乎
why need you delay it or speed it on its way?’

孟孫陽
因顧與其徒
說他事
_Meng Sun-yang_
_thereupon turned to his disciples_
_and changed the subject._

[^7-9]: This passage (with the succeeding dialogue)
does not come from the hedonist author;
it is a garbled account of the doctrines of the historical Yang Chu
from a much older source,
probably a document of the rival school of Mo-tzǔ,
the advocate of universal love.
The original doctrine of Yang Chu is still visible behind the passage,
which makes much better sense when its distortion is corrected:

    ‘Po-ch’eng Tzu-kao would not accept any external benefit
at the cost of one hair;
he renounced his state and retired to plough the fields . . .
When no one would lose a hair,
and no one would take the Empire,
the Empire was in good order.’

    In the dialogue which follows,
it is clear that Yang Chu and his disciple
are arguing against the sacrifice of a hair to ‘gain a kingdom’,
while Ch’in Ku-li (a disciple of Mo-tzǔ)
interprets this as refusing to ‘help the world’.
This is why it embarrasses Ch’in Ku-li
to admit that he would not cripple himself to gain a kingdom;
it amounts to admitting that he would refuse the opportunity
to benefit its people by good government (cf. pp. 135 ff. above).

_He is the most intelligent of living things._

_Hence_
_the most valuable use of knowledge_
_is for self-preservation,_

_‘However,_
_my body is not my possession;_

_I have no choice but to keep it intact._

_Other things are not my possessions;_
既有

身固生之主
_Certainly,_

_‘Although I keep life and body intact,_
_I cannot possess this body;_
雖不去物

有其物

_To possess these things,_
_possess this body,_
是橫私天下之身
橫私天下之物
不橫私天下之身
不橫私天下物者

_body and things_
_which belong to the world._

其唯聖人乎
公天下之身
公天下之物
其唯至人矣
_Is it not only the sage,_
_only the highest man,_
_who treats as common possessions the body_
_and the things which belong to the world?_

此之謂至至者也
_It is this which is meant by “highest of the highest”.’_[^7-11]

[^7-11]: This passage is clearly not the work of the hedonist author;
nor, since it values knowledge,
does it seem to be characteristically Taoist.
It discusses the relative importance of external possessions
and the preservation of one’s body,
the problem which engaged the historical Yang Chu,
and perhaps comes from some offshoot of his school.
The extreme doctrine, ascribed to Yang Chu himself,
that the body should always be preferred,
is rejected on the grounds that (1) Men, unlike animals,
cannot exist without external possessions,
(2) We cannot possess even the body (cf. p. 29 above),
since we cannot prevent it undergoing the processes of growth and decay
common to all things.

_never stop running after a good reputation._

名固不可去
名固不可賓邪
_Is a reputation really indispensable,_
_is it really impossible to treat it as a passing guest?_

***

今
有名則尊榮
亡名則卑辱
_Now_
_a good reputation brings honour and glory,_
_a bad one umiliation and disgrace._

尊榮則逸樂
卑辱則憂苦
_Honour and glory bring ease and joy,_
_humiliation and disgrace bring care and vexation._

憂苦犯性者也
逸樂順性者也
_It is care and vexation which go against our nature,_
_ease and joy which accord with it._

斯實之所係矣
_Then a real gain is attached to reputation._

名胡可去
名胡可賓
_How can we dispense with it,_
_how can we treat it as a passing guest?_

但惡夫
守名
而累實
_The one thing we should dislike_
_is getting involved in real difficulties_
_by clinging to reputation._

守名
而累實
將恤危亡之不救
_If you involve yourself in real difficulties_
_by clinging to it,_
_you will have irremediable ruin to worry about,_
豈徒
逸樂
憂苦
之閒哉
_not only_
_the choice between_
_ease and care,_
_joy and vexation!_
